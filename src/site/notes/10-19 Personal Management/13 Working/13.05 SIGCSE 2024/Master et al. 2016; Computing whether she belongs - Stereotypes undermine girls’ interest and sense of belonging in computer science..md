> [!abstract]
> Computer science has one of the largest gender disparities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. An important reason for this disparity is that girls are less likely than boys to enroll in necessary “pipeline courses,” such as introductory computer science. Two experiments investigated whether high-school girls’ lower interest than boys in enrolling in computer science courses is influenced by stereotypes of the field. We further tested whether these stereotypes can be communicated by the physical classroom environment, and whether changing this environment alters girls’ interest. In 2 experiments (N ϭ 269), a computer science classroom that did not project current computer science stereotypes caused girls, but not boys, to express more interest in taking computer science than a classroom that made these stereotypes salient. The gender difference was mediated by girls’ lower sense of belonging in the course, even beyond the effects of negative stereotype concerns, expectations of success, and utility value. Girls’ lower sense of belonging could be traced to lower feelings of fit with computer science stereotypes. Individual differences in fit with stereotypes predicted girls’ belonging and interest in a stereotypical, but not a nonstereotypical, classroom. Adolescence is a critical time for career aspirations. Girls may avoid computer science courses because current prevailing stereotypes of the field signal to them that they do not belong. However, providing them with an educational environment that does not fit current computer science stereotypes increases their interest in computer science courses and could provide grounds for interventions to help reduce gender disparities in computer science enrollment.

>In 2 experiments (N   269), a computer science classroom that did not project current computer science stereotypes caused girls, but not boys, to express more interest in taking computer science than a classroom that made these stereotypes salient. The gender difference was mediated by girls’ lower sense of belonging in the course, even beyond the effects of negative stereotype concerns, expectations of success, and utility value. Girls’ lower sense of belonging could be traced to lower feelings of fit with computer science stereotypes. Individual differences in fit with stereotypes predicted girls’ belonging and interest in a stereotypical, but not a nonstereotypical, classroom.

> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Most previous research on stereotypes about the field of computer science has been conducted with college students. However, adolescence is a particularly important age to examine for both theoretical and practical reasons. In terms of theory, adolescence is a critical time for identity formation. Middle adolescence (ages 14 –15) is when opposing self-attributes begin to bother students and remain a source of internal conflict, particularly for girls (Harter, 1990). In terms of practice, younger students are starting to make critical career choices (Weisgram &amp; Bigler, 2006), and are at a key age in which to intervene to decrease gender disparities in STEM (Lupart &amp; Cannon, 2002). Because the decision to forgo even one feeder course can effectively prevent students from majoring in STEM (Moses, Howe, &amp; Niesz, 1999), investigating factors that encourage girls to enter introductory “pipeline” courses is crucial. Girls’ sense of “belonging” in an academic environment may have a particularly strong influence on their interest. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FIJ5GK7R?page=2&annotation=WV5BFFYG)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Belonging. Four items were averaged to assess how much students felt that they belonged in this class (see Cheryan et al., 2009 for previous reliability and validity of scale). Students rated how similar they were to the students who take this class, how much they thought they belonged in this class, how well they would fit in the general environment of this class, and how well they would fit in with the students in this class (1   not at all and 7   extremely). Reliability was high for both classrooms (stereotypical classroom:   .94; nonstereotypical classroom:   .92). ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FIJ5GK7R?page=5&annotation=B6LDU65I)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Girls’ self-reported interest in enrolling in an introductory computer science course was significantly increased when the classroom environment was altered so that it did not fit high school students’ current stereotypes of computer science. In contrast, boys’ self-reported interest in computer science did not differ across the two classrooms. ([7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FIJ5GK7R?page=7&annotation=EQJE4TP6)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>The stereotypical environment was more of a deterrent for girls than boys. Girls felt lower belonging in the stereotypical environment than the nonstereotypical environment (with a small-tomoderate effect size of d   0.40), and this lower belonging mediated the gender differences in interest in the stereotypical computer science course. The stereotypical classroom also increased girls’ concerns about negative stereotypes about their gender; however, negative stereotype concerns did not predict girls’ enrollment interest. Classrooms that communicate a greater sense of belonging to girls may be particularly effective in encouraging them to enter those courses.

> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Experiment 2 revealed that girls reported more interest in enrolling in an introductory computer science course when the physical environment was nonstereotypical compared with stereotypical, with a moderate-to-large effect size of d   0.61. In contrast, boys’ self-reported interest in the course did not depend on the classroom environment. ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FIJ5GK7R?page=10&annotation=WNTW74QE)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Consistent with the previous experiment, belonging remained a mediator of the gender differences in interest in the computer science course with a stereotypical environment. When computer science stereotypes were evident, girls felt lower belonging in the course than boys, and this lower belonging predicted their reduced interest. Moreover, belonging predicted interest in computer science even after controlling for girls’ expectations of success and the value they placed on computer science. ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FIJ5GK7R?page=10&annotation=V4QHDXFX)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>girls were less interested in the stereotypical classroom than the nonstereotypical classroom (with a moderate-to-large effect size of d   .61), while boys showed no difference in interest. Why did these stereotypes affect girls but not boys? Mediational analyses in both experiments indicated that gender differences in interest in the stereotypical classroom were driven by differences in how much girls and boys felt they belonged in that environment. When girls felt that they belonged in the environment, they became more interested in taking the course. ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FIJ5GK7R?page=10&annotation=LW26PMRV))
