> [!abstract]
> Retaining students in computer science majors has been a persistent topic among computer science educators for almost two decades. Researchers have examined the relationship between belonging and engagement, self-efficacy, retention and persistence. Our quantitative research suggests that a student’s sense of belonging is related to a student’s perception of his ability, possibly more so than to actual performance. Our qualitative analysis further suggests that feelings of belonging can influence students’ attitudes toward the mutability of ability, based on conversation and support from their academic and nonacademic communities. Supporting a student’s sense of belonging both to the discipline and their supportive communities can improve the academic resilience of computer science students, thus improving retention.

>Our quantitative research suggests that a student’s sense of belonging is related to a student’s perception of his ability, possibly more so than to actual performance. Our qualitative analysis further suggests that feelings of belonging can influence students’ attitudes toward the mutability of ability, based on conversation and support from their academic and nonacademic communities.

> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Belonging has proven to be especially relevant to engagement, persistence, and drop-out at the K–12 level (e.g., [8,9,20]). ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VRL4R7PJ?page=1&annotation=3X3KCCSB)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>One factor in the retention/persistence puzzle is the specific connection between belonging and the student’s perception of his academic ability. Wilson et al. [23] found that an increased sense of belonging is connected to perceptions of technical competence. Floyd-Smith et al. posit conceptual connections between belonging and academic outcomes for undergraduate engineers. Belonging is also linked to self-efficacy, that is, the belief in one’s ability to succeed, in academic environments [24].

> [!research-questions]+ Research Questions  
>In the work presented here, we focus on a more narrow aspect of this larger question: what is the relationship between a sense of belonging and a student’s assessment of their own ability to perform in a given field? ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VRL4R7PJ?page=2&annotation=FGLQ89LY)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>The surveys included several scales that assessed the students’ self-reported self-efficacy, academic performance, and sense of belonging. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VRL4R7PJ?page=2&annotation=XQKJN8QP)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Self-efficacy was defined as the self-appraisal of one’s ability to master a task, and included judgments about one’s ability to accomplish a task as well as one’s confidence in one’s skills to perform that task. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VRL4R7PJ?page=2&annotation=J3BDI5II)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Self-efficacy was measured using five items (Table 1) from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) [17, 18]. Students responded to each item using a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Responses were summed for a total score with higher values representing a greater sense of self-efficacy. The internal consistency of the scale was strong (Cronbach’s alpha = .88). ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VRL4R7PJ?page=2&annotation=JBBSFEAD)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>The survey included questions that directly asked about a student’s perception of belonging at several different levels of the educational organization: a specific class, the major, the university (Table 2). ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VRL4R7PJ?page=2&annotation=JRBGPHK7)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>As shown in the Table 3, belonging at all institutional levels correlated significantly with both self-efficacy and expected GPA. In fact, self-efficacy correlated more strongly with belonging than expected GPA, indicating that students are not merely basing their sense of belonging on grading, but on the larger set of attributes that contribute to a positive self-efficacy. To rephrase, a sense of competence and confidence is more strongly related to all indices of belonging and support than grades. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VRL4R7PJ?page=3&annotation=R5FCNAUJ)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Perhaps as interesting is the finding that students’ actual (reported) GPAs are not correlated with any sense of belonging. This may indicate that actual grades, per se, do not dissuade students from feeling they belong in the major, nor do majors retain students through granting good grades.
