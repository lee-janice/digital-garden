> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Drawing upon mixed methods (surveys and interviews), this study explores the quantitative variables associated with a sense of belonging for females in high school CS courses and provides qualitative insights from students to help explain why these factors matter. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=1&annotation=7JASVVQB)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>Pre/post survey analysis indicates that the courses are contributing to reducing pre-course gender gaps in students’ perceived efficacy and belonging in a CS classroom. The surveys also suggest that females were more engaged and developed stronger relationships with teachers. And yet, females’ commitments to continuing with CS had no statistically significant changes. Student interviews provide important context regarding the quantitative findings and describe how positive relationships with a female teacher, collaborative work and inclusive teaching practices played key roles in promoting a classroom sense of belonging for females. Overall, these results suggest that an academically engaging and socioemotionally supportive experience in a computer science course can reduce gender gaps and foster females’ sense of belonging in the classroom even if they retain some reservations over their long-term fit in the field. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=1&annotation=LLE24RDF)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>High school computer science courses, especially those with a computer programming component, have the potential to narrow the gender gap in the field [17, 30, 31] ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=1&annotation=CPVKDDDQ)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Research Questions  
>The paper focuses on the following questions: (1) How do student experiences in, and perceptions of, high school computer science courses vary by gender? (2) What are the factors that influence students’ sense of belonging in these courses? ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=1&annotation=JPCRGPPY)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>For females, stereotypes about who goes into computing play an oversized role in their underrepresentation in computer science courses [15, 22]. For females who do enroll in computer science, many have been put off by male dominated spaces and pedagogy that emphasizes individual work and content that seems decontextualized from real world applications [13, 18]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=2&annotation=EHTA35ZK)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Definitions of a sense of belonging can vary, but a common definition of school belonging for students is “the extent to which they feel personally accepted, respected, included, and supported by others -especially teachers and other adults in the school environment” [12]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=2&annotation=H57FUQ4X)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>In computer science education research, a sense of belonging tends to focus on an individual’s assessment of the fit between how they see themselves and their image of people in the field of computer science [15] ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=2&annotation=VDYR3H9A)) 


 

 
>we have statements related to this in "gender stereotypes."

> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>omputer science education research would benefit from further exploration of the interplay between belonging at the classroom level and a sense of belonging or fit with the field of computer science that is shaped by stereotypes at the structural level. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=2&annotation=7QLEE8GU)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>This study followed a mixed methods convergent design procedure with the intent to compare the quantitative and qualitative data and provide a more complete understanding of an issue [7]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=2&annotation=8V57WTLE)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>A goal was to measure changes in student perceptions, so the pre- and post-course surveys contained a common set of questions asking students to rate their level of agreement with statements about their CS abilities/knowledge, sense of belonging, and future plans. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=PY92QFYT)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>In a statistical analysis of the survey data, we used two approaches to compare mean responses. Comparisons between male and female students were tested using two-sample t-tests to examine average differences between groups. Comparisons of responses between the pre- and post-course surveys were tested using pairedsample t-tests that examine average changes in students’ responses over time. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=K3L7W3G2)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Thirty-four high school students in the Discovering CS or the CSIS110 course were interviewed, most twice, for a total of 61 interviews. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=6PU2KXGS)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>In the collection and analysis of data, a phenomenological approach was used to focus on students’ accounts of their lived experiences in computer science courses [6]. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=DYRYVYBP)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Findings indicate that females had lower levels of self-perceived efficacy, belonging, and future commitments to computer science than males at the start of the computer science classes. Yet, students’ responses after taking the class indicate stronger engagement, classroom belonging, and teacher-student relationships for females compared to males. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=NBIUYX5J)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Post-survey responses suggest females were very satisfied with their relationships with their teachers in these courses, which is also correlated with a sense of belonging at the classroom level (see Table 2). ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=2C7PSXHH)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>The survey data shows many impacts on students’ perceptions of efficacy in computing, with evidence that the course reduced female and male gender gaps for this variable. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=4&annotation=S2FUNY4W)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>Overall, the mean female responses tended to show more growth from the pre- to post-survey, but males maintained higher post-survey assessments. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=4&annotation=V99WK4YF)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Female responses to questions associated with a sense of belonging point to some of the challenges for females in developing a sense of fit to the field of computer science. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=4&annotation=PM4CWHLJ)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>It may be that the courses are fostering a sense of belonging for the females at the classroom level, however, not seeing people like them in their courses may reinforce gender stereotypes about who is interested in CS and suppress their sense of belonging or fit in the field [22] . ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=4&annotation=VS2DEENH)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Course level factors such as caring teachers, collaboration, and an assignment to research underrepresented computer scientists helped to promote positive experiences and a sense of belonging in the course for female students despite classrooms that were overwhelmingly male. Males tended to see the same factors as mildly positive or neutral. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=5&annotation=P9QDFEL9)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>For females, belonging in the course was more likely to be related to interpersonal dynamics, while males’ level of comfort and belonging were almost always associated with the degree to which they felt they were mastering the course content. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=5&annotation=Q9XXATSY)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>Quality relationships with their female CS teachers were key to female students’ sense of belonging ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=5&annotation=UM5YPTK3)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>These comments suggest that a caring female teacher can serve as a powerful role model and positively impact females’ confidence and persistence in CS, which are key components of belonging. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=5&annotation=NGY43UH7)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>This supports the argument that a greater understanding of careers in CS may promote more interest in the field for females [30]. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=5&annotation=7RS5YYGX)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>The assignments and discussions around diversity seemed to be more important to the females interviewed ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=5&annotation=TLD4TU24)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>And these activities changed how some females saw themselves and their capacity to do computer science. For males, they generally either saw the activities as interesting, important to know about, or a bit tangential to the core programming of the course. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=5&annotation=E2GJXREJ)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>Despite positive experiences in their CS courses, females’ longterm commitments to CS were less certain and contingent on multiple factors, whereas males’ commitments to CS tended to be stronger and based primarily on their interest in coding ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=5&annotation=QQRAS8RB)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>Consistent with other research, a few females’ commitments to CS were tempered by expected inequalities in the field. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=5&annotation=EAHHJZ8M)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>Based on the quantitative data alone, this classroom level belonging did not translate into a statistically significant increase in females’ interest in pursuing a future in computer science. However, the interviews with females suggest that the course did increase their interest in the field, just with reservations ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=6&annotation=Z7B4K9LM)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>As documented in previous research [18, 28], this study also found that relationships and belonging mattered more to females than males ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=6&annotation=GRL7JSUI)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>Moreover, female role models are linked to persistence in CS [13], and they may be especially important to bolster female confidence and counter situations when stereotype threat could be triggered [21 ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=6&annotation=I3B8QK5J)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>n addition, the qualitative interviews provide evidence that a diversity project helped females discover female role models in the field who served as inspiration for their success in computer science. Lastly, the collaborative work fostered both a sense of belonging to the classroom and the field of computer science. ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=6&annotation=8MAPZY5E)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>This suggests that the course curriculum was helping the students make more informed decisions about their careers. In addition, this positive pre-college experience may make it more likely for these females to retain a sense of belonging and self-efficacy in computer science when in college, even if the environment is less welcoming ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=6&annotation=KS74SKZX)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>In future analysis of the study data, it would be informative to also explore how factors like belonging, efficacy, and commitments to CS may differ by the kind of school, course type, and student level characteristics (race, class, and previous academic record).
