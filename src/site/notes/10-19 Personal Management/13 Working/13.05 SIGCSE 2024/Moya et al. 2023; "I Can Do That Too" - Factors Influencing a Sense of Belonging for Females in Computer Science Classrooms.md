> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Drawing upon mixed methods (surveys and interviews), this study explores the quantitative variables associated with a sense of belonging for females in high school CS courses and provides qualitative insights from students to help explain why these factors matter. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=1&annotation=7JASVVQB)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>Pre/post survey analysis indicates that the courses are contributing to reducing pre-course gender gaps in students’ perceived efficacy and belonging in a CS classroom. The surveys also suggest that females were more engaged and developed stronger relationships with teachers. And yet, females’ commitments to continuing with CS had no statistically significant changes. Student interviews provide important context regarding the quantitative findings and describe how positive relationships with a female teacher, collaborative work and inclusive teaching practices played key roles in promoting a classroom sense of belonging for females. Overall, these results suggest that an academically engaging and socioemotionally supportive experience in a computer science course can reduce gender gaps and foster females’ sense of belonging in the classroom even if they retain some reservations over their long-term fit in the field. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=1&annotation=LLE24RDF)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Research Questions  
>The paper focuses on the following questions: (1) How do student experiences in, and perceptions of, high school computer science courses vary by gender? (2) What are the factors that influence students’ sense of belonging in these courses? ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=1&annotation=JPCRGPPY)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Definitions of a sense of belonging can vary, but a common definition of school belonging for students is “the extent to which they feel personally accepted, respected, included, and supported by others -especially teachers and other adults in the school environment” [12]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=2&annotation=H57FUQ4X)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>This study followed a mixed methods convergent design procedure with the intent to compare the quantitative and qualitative data and provide a more complete understanding of an issue [7]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=2&annotation=8V57WTLE)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>In a statistical analysis of the survey data, we used two approaches to compare mean responses. Comparisons between male and female students were tested using two-sample t-tests to examine average differences between groups. Comparisons of responses between the pre- and post-course surveys were tested using pairedsample t-tests that examine average changes in students’ responses over time. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=K3L7W3G2)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Thirty-four high school students in the Discovering CS or the CSIS110 course were interviewed, most twice, for a total of 61 interviews. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=6PU2KXGS)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>In the collection and analysis of data, a phenomenological approach was used to focus on students’ accounts of their lived experiences in computer science courses [6]. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=DYRYVYBP)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Findings indicate that females had lower levels of self-perceived efficacy, belonging, and future commitments to computer science than males at the start of the computer science classes. Yet, students’ responses after taking the class indicate stronger engagement, classroom belonging, and teacher-student relationships for females compared to males. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=NBIUYX5J)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Post-survey responses suggest females were very satisfied with their relationships with their teachers in these courses, which is also correlated with a sense of belonging at the classroom level (see Table 2). ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=3&annotation=2C7PSXHH)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>The survey data shows many impacts on students’ perceptions of efficacy in computing, with evidence that the course reduced female and male gender gaps for this variable. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=4&annotation=S2FUNY4W)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Female responses to questions associated with a sense of belonging point to some of the challenges for females in developing a sense of fit to the field of computer science. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=4&annotation=PM4CWHLJ)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Course level factors such as caring teachers, collaboration, and an assignment to research underrepresented computer scientists helped to promote positive experiences and a sense of belonging in the course for female students despite classrooms that were overwhelmingly male. Males tended to see the same factors as mildly positive or neutral. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U8GUJ5KU?page=5&annotation=P9QDFEL9)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>In future analysis of the study data, it would be informative to also explore how factors like belonging, efficacy, and commitments to CS may differ by the kind of school, course type, and student level characteristics (race, class, and previous academic record).
