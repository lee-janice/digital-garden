> [!abstract]
> Prior research has shown that a sense of belonging is very important for students to continue in their field of study. This is particularly true for minoritized students in introductory CS courses. The methods used so far to study sense of belonging in CS have been qualitative or have used a small number of survey items. In this paper, we validate a large 30-item survey originally developed for Mathematics. We collected data from 21 institutions, with 30 faculty and 1165 survey responses. We present a factor analysis for the survey to highlight how it measures factors like ‘Membership’, ‘Acceptance’, ‘Affect’, ‘Trust’ and ‘Desire to Fade’. We measured the students’ sense of belonging using the survey and found that it correlates with their learning and their interest to pursue more CS courses. These correlations were nuanced based on students’ gender, race, and the type of learning environment. We found that for minoritized students in particular, the interest to pursue CS courses was more correlated with their sense of belonging. A type of learning environment we examined was Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). We studied the differences in sense of belonging between POGIL and non-POGIL classrooms. Although we did not find a significant difference in overall sense of belonging at the factor level, we did find significant differences when we examined at the item level. These results shed light about nuances in students’ sense of belonging in CS POGIL classrooms when compared to other approaches.

> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Sense of belonging is broadly the feeling of ‘fitting in’ or being an integral part of an environment [2, 8]. Prior research has shown that a student’s sense of belonging is positively associated with student outcomes such as their motivation, grades, interest in a field, and the intent to pursue college or persist in a field [2, 11, 13, 26]. Research in computing education has also shown that a sense of belonging is important for students to develop an interest in the field and decide to take Computer Science (CS) courses [13]. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=1&annotation=C2VK9IAT)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>In quantitative terms, ‘sense of belonging’ is a latent variable—it cannot be observed directly, but it can be estimated using its effects on other observable variables [22]. So, using an appropriate technique to gauge ‘sense of belonging’ is important. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=1&annotation=IR5AZZE3)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Further, we investigated the correlation between students’ sense of belonging, their learning outcomes, and their interest to pursue more CS courses. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=1&annotation=6CUCNQEW)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Research Questions  
>In this work, we address the following research questions: (1) What factors emerge from an exploratory factor analysis of the 30-item sense of belonging survey adapted for CS? (2) How does sense of belonging correlate with students’ interest to pursue CS and their learning outcomes? (3) How does students’ sense of belonging differ between POGIL and other learning environments? ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=2&annotation=X4W7V7UN)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>For example, Master and colleagues found that a ‘stereotypical’ CS classroom environment negatively affected young women in high schools [13]. Their sense of belonging was lower in stereotypical classrooms compared to ‘non-stereotypical’ classrooms, but the classroom environment did not seem to affect men’s sense of belonging. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=2&annotation=Y5M3HR4K)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Mooney and colleagues measured their students’ sense of belonging in order to diversify the CS department based on gender [16]. They found that women had a lower sense of belonging compared to men. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=2&annotation=NVF35KUK)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>In addition, Stout and Wright found that LGBTQ students were more likely to leave their computing major due to a low sense of belonging compared to other students [25]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=2&annotation=9LWR334C)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Further, researchers have emphasized the need to look at intersectionality based on race and ethnicity for women when studying sense of belonging for STEM majors [10, 19]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=2&annotation=UPERLNWZ)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Others have highlighted that intersectional frameworks should use both quantitative and qualitative data [15]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=2&annotation=27IQTBWQ)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Nuñez empirically found that it was important to use sophisticated techniques, like Structural Equation Modelling that examines complex relationships, to gauge how sense of belonging predicted various outcomes for Latinx students [18]. They highlighted that a “one size fits all approach should not be applied to all racial/ethnic groups when measuring sense of belonging.” ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=2&annotation=MPESJYL4)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Consent forms, surveys, and learning assessments were collected from CS1 students of 30 faculty at 21 two-year and four-year institutions. There were a total of 1165 survey responses from the students. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=3&annotation=5EZEWB3P)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Over three semesters (Spring 2019, Fall 2019, Spring 2020), 1165 students in 45 CS1 courses completed the sense of belonging surveys mid-semester, before the course withdrawal deadline (see Table 1). ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=3&annotation=VQ4GBUEF)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>To answer the second research question, we conducted correlation analyses between the six factors, students’ learning outcomes, and their interest to pursue in CS using the entire dataset. We also conducted correlational analysis to examine relationship between students’ total sense of belonging, learning outcomes, and interest to pursue CS based on their gender, race/ethnicity, and the learning environment (POGIL vs non-POGIL). Note that the total sense of belonging is a composite score from the average of the individual factor scores. We also used Fisher r-to-z transformation to determine if two correlation coefficients were significantly different. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=3&annotation=2KABF73Z))

> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>We found that all the six individual factors significantly correlated with each other. These correlations confirmed our choice of using oblique rotation in our parallel analysis. We also found that students’ sense of belonging factor scores correlated significantly with their interest to pursue CS and their learning assessments (see Table 3). There were, however, certain variations in these correlations. Using Fisher r-to-z transformation, we found that ‘Membership’ correlated more strongly with interest to pursue CS than to the learning assessments. On the other hand, ‘Affect’ seemed to be more strongly correlated with the learning assessments than an interest to pursue CS. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=4&annotation=FURRX4K5)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Table 4 shows how the composite sense of belonging scores correlated differently in various contexts. These results suggest the interest to pursue CS seems to be more related to minoritized students’ sense of belonging. For instance, the sense of belonging seemed to correlate more strongly (based on Fisher r-to-z transformation) with the interest to pursue CS for both Black and Latinx students compared to Asian students. The learning assessments, however, were not significantly correlated with sense of belonging for non-White students. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=4&annotation=MFUQN6MV)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Finally, for the POGIL learning environment, sense of belonging seemed to be more correlated (but note not significantly, according to Fisher r to z transformation) with the interest to pursue CS and the learning assessments compared to non-POGIL conditions.

> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Our analyses suggested that sense of belonging is correlated with students’ CS1 learning assessment as well as their interest to pursue more CS courses. Furthermore, our results suggest that certain individual factors, like ‘Membership’, are more associated with an interest to pursue more CS courses, while other factors like ‘Affect’ seemed to be closely associated with learning outcomes. The results also suggest that students’ sense of belonging in POGIL classrooms had higher correlation with learning and interest to pursue CS as compared to students’ sense of belonging in nonPOGIL classrooms. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=5&annotation=3TKAUW54)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>The results also suggested that that sense of belonging for minoritized students (Black and Latinx), as measured by this survey, was more associated with their interest to pursue CS. These survey results are, thus, in alignment with the existing literature that suggests that sense of belonging is more strongly associated with interest to pursue CS for minoritized students compared to others [13, 25]. These findings in conjunction with prior work that formal peer relationships are important for all students, but especially for minoritized students’ sense of belonging [14], highlight that future work should examine how to create experiences in CS1 that would help support positive peer relationships in an equitable and inclusive manner. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=5&annotation=A6SEL5B9)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>We also found that the sense of belonging scores were not significantly correlated with learning assessment scores for race and ethnically minoritized students. There could be several reasons for this, such as small sample sizes, other factors being more associated with the learning assessments, the nature of the learning assessments or the belonging survey itself which might need more refinements to better cater to non-White students [6, 17]. Although we cannot conclusively point to any one ‘true’ reason, we feel that this opens up to the community the areas that needs more attention and research. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CPF8WZYT?page=5&annotation=ZJ8EBJFL)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>Future work should examine other factors that might be important for minoritized students’ sense of belonging and the complex relationships all the factors may have with learning assessments. In particular, many researchers now focus on exclusively examining minoritized students’ sense of belonging in contextualized manner instead of in a comparative manner with other groups of students.
