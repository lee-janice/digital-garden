### Defining sense of belonging

The authors define sense of belonging as "the feeling of fitting in or being an integral part of an environment".

### Research topic

This study was threefold: the authors 
1. presented a factor analysis of a 30-item survey to measure sense of belonging in CS,
2. studied how students' sense of belonging using the survey correlated to their learning and interest to pursue more CS, and
3. studied differences in sense of belonging between Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) classrooms and non-POGIL classrooms. 

### Methods

Correlational analysis; Fisher r-to-z transformation to determine if two correlation coefficients were significantly different

### Results

Table 3: All individual factors correlated with each other, and with students' interest to pursue CS and their learning assessments.

Table 4: Sense of belonging seemed to correlate more strongly (based on Fisher r-to-z transformation) with the interest to pursue CS for both Black and Latinx students compared to Asian students.
