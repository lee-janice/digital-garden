> The underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in computer science presents a challenge for training the next generation of scientists. The decision to pursue a professional and academic career in computing can be influenced by early experiences and mindsets in K-12 learning environments. However, we have a limited understanding of how student mindsets influence engagement in a variety of classroom contexts during high school computer science classes--one of the early gateways to computer science. We conducted a national longitudinal study of students in advanced placement computer science courses to understand how student mindsets impact engagement, how their mindsets evolve over time, and how contextual factors at the teacher, classroom, and school level can influence these temporal dynamics. We find that mindsets differentially impact engagement and vary by students’ gender and status of racial underrepresentation. Some mindsets change over time due to course feedback, and these changes affect engagement and performance in different ways. Class characteristics (e.g., class size and female proportion) and school characteristics (e.g., proportion of students who are eligible for free lunch and proportion of racially underrepresented students) moderate the effect of mindsets on student outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings for learning theories and equity-focused educational practices.

>For example, STEM disciplines like computer science have long struggled, and continue to struggle, to train and retain women and racial and ethnic minority students (Fry et al., 2021; Lord et al., 2011). ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HYIWSWAZ?page=3&annotation=UACGTEQJ)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Overall, from a social welfare perspective, chronic underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in computing undermines the nation’s ability to reduce inequities that are related to bias in algorithms or the design of technology, because some issues are more likely to be noticed by people with marginalized identities (Lewis, in press; O’Neil, 2016; Ray, 2019).

> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Throughout K-12 education, female students, for example, are reported to develop mindsets that STEM fields are for males and thereby females may not belong there (Bian et al., 2017; Bian et al., 2018; Master et al., 2016). Female students’ beliefs about STEM careers and their low sense of belonging are often pointed out to be one of the reasons why they avoid majoring in STEM in college (Makarova et al., 2019; Cundiff et al., 2013).

> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>To examine patterned variation in mindsets across students, we analyzed whether gender and URM status predict students’ mindsets at the start of the course. As shown in Table 3, we found that female students started the course with significantly lower expectations of classroom belonging (belonging) and they found the course less relevant to their future (personal relevance) compared to male students. Similarly, URM students also showed a lower sense of belonging in the course (belonging) and lower relevance to the course (personal relevance) compared to non-URM students. While female students were more worried than male students about their lack of experience in computer science (worries about CS) and that their gender/race would negatively influence how others perceive their capability for computer science (stereotype threat), URM students were more worried than non-URM students about their lack of experience in math (worries about math).
