> [!abstract]
> Sense of belonging, or belongingness, is an important factor in a student’s academic life as it is associated with factors such as motivation and persistence, in addition to mental health and well-being. Belongingness has been shown to be correlated with factors such as gender, race, nationality, socio-economic status, religion and disability. Previous work has shown lower belongingness of minoritised women in computing compared to other computing students. However, it is not well known how belongingness in computing compares to other disciplines. This is a difficult comparison to draw as belongingness is closely related to specific contexts including learning environment, and therefore one’s discipline.

> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>In this specific study we found that belongingness is not statistically significantly different across genders overall. However, minoritised students have statistically significantly lower belongingness, which varies by gender. We also found that the belongingness of computer science students is statistically significantly lower than that of other science students and that belongingness varies across science disciplines by gender and minoritisation.

> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>There is an acknowledged lack of diversity in computing [44], and not unlike many other STEM disciplines [10] there is evidence of racist and misogynistic issues throughout the pipeline [28, 32, 42]. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=1&annotation=R7CX9CQG)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>This is particularly problematic for Black women and girls where the intersection of racialisation and gender have led to further marginalisation and discrimination [32, 42]. This lack of diversity and cultural competence creates a culture that excludes those do not fit the White and Asian male stereotype of computing [43]. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=1&annotation=V4V7G3LZ)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Those that do study/work in computer science but who do not fit this stereotype often leave due to disillusionment [44]. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=1&annotation=ZSML4MWA)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>A ‘sense of belonging’, or ‘belongingness’ can be described as the “personal belief that one is an accepted member of an academic community whose presence and contributions are valued” [13, p711]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=2&annotation=GBBH7GRP)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Belonging is a critical dimension of academic success and can affect a student’s degree of academic adjustment, achievement, aspirations, or even whether they complete their studies [41]. Belongingness is also a critical factor in building and maintaining equitable and inclusive learning environments. Belongingness is influenced by many environmental factors [26] including students’ backgrounds and experiences [15], people (colleagues [39] and professors [12]), place/environment (physical [40] and virtual [22]), context such as the discipline [13] and part-time/full-time status [18], external factors such as local, regional, and global landscapes [9], and time [1].

> [!research-questions]+ Research Questions  
>Our research questions are: (1) How does the sense of belonging of students in science, including computer science, vary by gender identity and minoritisation? (2) How does the sense of belonging of computer science students compare to other science students? ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=2&annotation=WAHYD6E3)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Research Questions  
>(3) How does sense of belonging vary by gender identity and minoritisation for students in computer science compared to other science students? ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=2&annotation=98P9T4AQ)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>In computing belongingness is a known predictor of motivation and persistence [5]. It has been shown that belongingness can be predictive of pass rates, final exam scores and course grades for early-stage computing students - a finding that was noted as concerning by the authors [19]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=2&annotation=9JAVNJT7)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Biggers et al. [3] provided evidence that belongingness is extremely important in computing, showing that the most significant factor that caused women to leave computing was feeling that they do not belong. This was the second most significant factor for men. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=2&annotation=HXTUD92Y)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Lewis et al. studied the belongingness of 1,735 undergraduate computing students (453 women; 1,282 men) with a focus on gender disparity [20]. These students were recruited from 68 computing departments across the United States. They found that women’s self-reported sense of belonging was on average over half a standard deviation lower than men’s. Lewis et al. carried out a similar analysis on 855 graduate computing students (315 women, 540 men) from the same set of institutions (reported in the same paper [20]) and found a similar but slightly smaller difference in the sense of belonging between women and men. In both samples, a low sense of belonging was a significant predictor of thoughts about leaving their studies among women. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=2&annotation=AX7BDNMA)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Mooney &amp; Becker [25] observed a lower sense of belonging in computing students who identified as women who also identified as being minoritised. However, students who identified as women who did not identify as being minoritised had a sense of belonging comparable to those identifying as men. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=3&annotation=8VF2P2IG)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Using data from over 1,000 introductory programming students at 21 institutions, Moudgalya et al. [27] used factor analysis to validate in a computing context a 30-item instrument developed for use in mathematics by Good et al. [13]. They found that the interest to pursue computer science courses for minoritised students was correlated with their sense of belonging. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=3&annotation=F5WE2XWP)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>The survey questions were adapted from the “Math Sense of Belonging Scale” [13] containing 18 positively-framed questions (e.g., I feel accepted/I feel respected/etc.) and 12 negatively-framed questions (e.g., I feel excluded/I feel disregarded/etc.). A similar adaptation of this instrument was validated by Moudgalya et al. for use in undergraduate computer science courses [27] (mentioned in Section 2). ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=3&annotation=4LK62R7C)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>For each item, participants rated their agreement on an 8-point Likert-like scale (1 strongly disagree → 8 strongly agree). ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=3&annotation=2ZK9UI3U)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>A Belongingness score was calculated as the sum of positively framed question scores minus the sum of negatively-framed question scores, identical to Good et al. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=3&annotation=NC99IABB)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>To test for statistical significance, we compared the means between groups and utilised Welch’s two-sample t-test (two-tailed), 𝛼 = 0 .05.4 One-way ANOVA was used to determine whether or not there is a statistically significant difference between the means of three or more independent groups, 𝛼 = 0.05. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CS3DD5HY?page=4&annotation=SKC4W5T7)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Missing values in responses deemed valid (e.g., skipping one Likert-like item) were replaced with the mean score for that item. Invalid responses (e.g., missing multiple items entirely, those from students outside of the College of Science, those from students who were not undergraduates) were removed, leaving 355 valid responses (response rate approx. 18%).
