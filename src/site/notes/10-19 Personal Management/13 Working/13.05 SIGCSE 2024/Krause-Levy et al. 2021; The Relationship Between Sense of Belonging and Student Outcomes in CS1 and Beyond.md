> [!abstract]
> Students’ sense of belonging has been found to be connected to student retention in higher education. In computing education, prior studies suggest that a hostile culture and a feeling of nonbelonging can lead women, Black, Latinx, Native American, and Pacific Islander students to drop out of the computing field at a disproportionately high rate. Yet, we know relatively little about how computing students’ sense of belonging presents and evolves (if at all) through their college courses, particularly in courses beyond the introductory level, and little is known about how sense of belonging impacts student outcomes in computing. In an extension of a previous study, we examined students’ sense of belonging in six early undergraduate computer science courses across three consecutive quarters at a large research-intensive institution in North America. We found that women and first generation students have a lower incoming sense of belonging across all courses. When exploring sense of belonging’s tie to student outcomes we found that lower sense of belonging was correlated with negative course outcomes in terms of pass rates and course performance. We also found that it is less tied to student performance as students get further into the CS curriculum. Surprisingly, there was no indication that sense of belonging is predictive of retention in terms of persistence to the next CS course outside of the first course in our two-course CS1 sequence.

>We found that women and first generation students have a lower incoming sense of belonging across all courses. When exploring sense of belonging’s tie to student outcomes we found that lower sense of belonging was correlated with negative course outcomes in terms of pass rates and course performance. We also found that it is less tied to student performance as students get further into the CS curriculum. Surprisingly, there was no indication that sense of belonging is predictive of retention in terms of persistence to the next CS course outside of the first course in our two-course CS1 sequence.

> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Women, first generation (FG), and transfer students have a lower sense of belonging. Consistent with previous findings, our results further demonstrate that women have a lower sense of belonging, not only in CS1 but across the entire lower division curriculum. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=FK2FZTQ5)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>BLNPI students do not have a lower sense of belonging. Our results did not find anything to signify that BLNPI students have a consistently lower or higher sense of belonging throughout the curriculum, adding to the mixed results in previous findings. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=7B3KKMVJ)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Sense of belonging is tied to academic outcomes. This relationship is strongest in introductory CS courses and weakens in more advanced courses. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=NDSXM5WX)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Sense of belonging is not tied to between class retention in later classes. We found evidence of a relationship between sense of belonging and retention between classes for non-CS majors in the first course of our two-course CS1 sequence, but found no such evidence for CS majors or for later courses in the curriculum. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=BEUDUITF)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Sense of belonging is tied to pass rate for our twocourse CS1 sequence. Sense of belonging is not tied to pass rate for later courses in the curriculum. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=GCL2N45F)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Sense of belonging has been shown to be tied to retention, academic standing, self worth, and other positive student outcomes [5, 20, 22, 24, 31]. Research inside and outside of computing has shown that sense of belonging is typically lower for underrepresented students in computing, including but not limited to women and BLNPI students, although the results for BLNPI students have not always replicated [6, 7, 11, 17, 19, 21, 26, 28, 30, 33]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=V8D8E8E2)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>While sense of belonging appears to be related to aspects of a successful college experience, a study by Veilleux et al. suggests that it might not (always) be related to STEM students’ academic performance. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=25XC95KQ)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Previous studies have identified factors that have a positive impact on a student’s sense of belonging such as having supportive peer relationships, perceiving faculty care about students on an individual level, academic self-efficacy, and motivation [4–6]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=SSV4JYI4)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Nguyen and Lewis studied the survey results of 1,245 first-year students in 80 CS departments. They found that women have a significantly lower sense of belonging than men, and that Black and Latinx students have a significantly lower sense of belonging than their White counterparts [21]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=AWDMCCNX)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Walton and Cohen found that Black students in computing have a lower sense of belonging, while Lewis et al. found that women have lower sense of belonging than men, and Asian and Black—but not Latinxstudents have lower sense of belonging than White students [11]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=3TWFF5CB)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>A multi-institutional study focused on CS1 by Sax et al. found that ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=2&annotation=R6GCWL9W)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>women had a lower incoming sense of belonging to the course than men, but that the incoming sense of belonging for BLNPI students was similar to that of White and Asian students [26]. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=3&annotation=BAID4LG6)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Stout and Wright found that LGBTQ students were more likely to think about leaving the major due to a lower sense of belonging than their heterosexual counterparts; the same was true of women compared to men [28]. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=3&annotation=DIMX9L8Z)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Moudgalya et al. studied student’s sense of belonging in introductory computing courses across 21 institutions, with 1165 participants. The results suggest that sense of belonging is correlated with students’ interest in taking more CS courses and student’s learning outcomes. For Black and Latinx students, sense of belonging was more associated with their interest in pursuing CS, although interestingly sense of belonging was not significantly correlated with a learning assessment used to measure student learning [20]. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=3&annotation=S9XZCAC5)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Blaney and Stout studied the relationship between introductory computing courses experiences and sense of belonging and self-efficacy. They found that first generation women have a statistically significantly lower sense of belonging and self-efficacy compared to their peers [2]. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=3&annotation=7F8MT3BJ)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Research Questions  
>To achieve these goals, we posed the following research questions: RQ-1: What do students in lower-division computing courses report as their incoming sense of belonging in computing; and how does this vary by gender, BLNPI, first-generation and transfer-student status? RQ-2: How does sense of belonging change over time both within a course and across courses as students work through the lower-division computing curriculum; and how does this vary by gender, BLNPI, first-generation and transfer-student status? RQ-3: Does sense of belonging correlate with student outcomes such as course pass rates, rates of retention between courses, overall course grades and final exam scores in computing courses? ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=3&annotation=8C4DPQXH)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Previous studies have used a variety of methods to combine the likert scaled ratings, such as summing [26, 27, 30, 32] or averaging [11, 14, 21, 28, 29] the ratings. We chose to sum the ratings because it was consistent with how these questions were aggregated in the original work [27] and to better match the study conducted by Sax et al. that we are expanding upon [26]. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=4&annotation=BGZLM2XA)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Sense of belonging scores, overall course grades and final exam scores were all normalized via z-score per course. Normalizing the data is especially important as students sense of belonging may vary by course and in the case of student grades and final exam scores, not all courses or course offerings are equally difficult. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=4&annotation=AH6WB6U7)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Using normality tests we found that our data was not normally distributed and therefore we applied non-parametric tests for our analysis. This includes using Mann-Whitney U tests instead of independent sample t-tests, Wilcox signed-rank tests instead of paired t-tests and Spearman correlations instead of Pearson correlations. Due to the large number of statistical tests run during our analysis we adjust our p-values to account for the increased chance of Type I errors. We used the Holm-Bonferroni adjustment method as it reduces the probability of introducing a Type II errors and allows for more statistical power [1]. Additionally, even though our data is non-parametric we chose to visualize our results using average sense of belonging scores per course as displaying averages can be easier to interpret visually than medians.

>Figure 2 shows the group sense of belonging score averages, by course, and is zoomed into the range between 13-18 (out of 4-20) to help readability. For each demographic pair (e.g. women vs. men) we used a Holm-Bonferroni-adjusted Mann-Whitney U test to test whether the distributions were statistically significantly different in incoming sense of belonging. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=5&annotation=APV2PGCE)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Overall, incoming sense of belonging fluctuates between courses, but there is no clear upward or downward trend as students progress through the first two years of coursework. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=5&annotation=6WWRVXWQ)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>In terms of group differences, we found the most robust differences by gender and first generation status (Figure 2, top and bottom left). In all courses, women and first generation students had a lower mean and median sense of belonging than their counterparts with the exception of Comp Org for women and CS1-Acc for first generation students, where the medians were equal. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=5&annotation=HJJJGCZH)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Considering race/ethnicity, we found mixed results (Figure 2, top right). ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=5&annotation=YLP3AXHI)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>For transfer students we found that they come in with a lower mean and median sense of belonging except in the case of CS1-Acc (Figure 2, bottom right). ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=5&annotation=25EATLHE)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Due to the robust differences we found for gender and first generation status, we chose to look at the intersectionality of gender with first generation status to see if the effect is compounded for first generation women. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=5&annotation=6BATVFA2)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>We found that first generation women have a lower mean and median sense of belonging than non-first generation women in 5/6 courses. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=5&annotation=NZQDK62R))

> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>We first looked at the relationship between sense of belonging and the likelihood of passing each course. We defined passing as receiving a letter grade of C- or higher. We used logistic regression with Holm-Bonferroni-adjusted p-values where the independent variable was the students’ incoming sense of belonging score and a binary measure of whether students passed the course was the dependent variable. We ran this for each course and we found sense of belonging score to be predictive of pass rates for CS1 and CS1.5. ([9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=9&annotation=U7DV9BLF)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>In addition to running logistic regression with the independent variable of students’ incoming sense of belonging we also ran it with the independent variables of sense of belonging, gender, BLNPI, first generation and transfer status with Holm-Bonferroni-adjusted p-values. Here we found that sense of belonging was predictive of passing the course for CS1 and CS1-Acc and gender was predictive of passing the course in all courses except CS1.5. This suggests that sense of belonging is related to passing the course in introductory courses, even when controlling for gender, but also vice versa: there are other factors hindering women’s performance in these courses (see Table 7). ([9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=9&annotation=7DUQI8XY)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>To determine whether incoming sense of belonging is correlated with students’ performance we used Spearman’s correlation between students’ sense of belonging and student’s course grades. The correlation coefficients and statistical significance can be seen in Table 10. We found that for CS1, CS1.5 and CS1-Acc and CS2 the results were statistically significant with the correlation coefficient generally decreasing in the later courses. This result suggests that incoming sense of belonging becomes less correlated with student performance in later courses. ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=10&annotation=IUD7T8RF)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>Although sense of belonging is distinct from self-efficacy [35], one can imagine how they might influence one another. Moreover, the persistence of a lack of sense of belonging with women may be connected to the recent finding of Rosenstein et al. that showed women experience considerably higher rates of Imposter Phenomenon than men [25]. It could be difficult for a student to feel like they belong if they feel like an imposter. Future work should explore these possible connections. ([11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FK3AJ2ZA?page=11&annotation=QDIM3RSG)) 


> [!future-work]+ Future Work  
>There is also the question of whether sense of belonging is simply a measurement of prior CS experiences. Because prior experience is tied to positive outcomes for students in CS [34], we wanted to see if our sense of belonging findings are simply a measure of prior experience as one can imagine having prior experiences in CS might make students feel like they belong in the community more than others who just entered it.
