> [!abstract]
> Creating inclusive learning environments for all students is of primary importance. Student sense of belonging is an important part of this. However, sense of belonging can show variations according to factors such as ethnicity and gender as well as influencing attributes such as motivation and persistence. We utilised a survey adapted from the “Math Sense of Belonging Scale” to examine the relationship between undergraduate computer science students’ sense of belonging, gender identity, and self-declared minority status. We observed a lower sense of belonging in students who identified as women who also self-identified as being part of a minority group. However, students who identified as women who did not identify as belonging to a minority had a sense of belonging comparable to those identifying as men. Our results provide insight that may help us improve the sense of belonging of our undergraduate students, particularly those identifying as women and as belonging to a minority in computer science. It has also brought to our attention that action needs to be taken to mitigate the potentially disproportionately negative consequences that COVID-19 may have on these students due to reduced opportunities for social interaction and the negative impact that this has on sense of belonging.

> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>We observed a lower sense of belonging in students who identified as women who also self-identified as being part of a minority group. However, students who identified as women who did not identify as belonging to a minority had a sense of belonging comparable to those identifying as men.

> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Sense of belonging has been described as “one’s personal belief that one is an accepted member of an academic community whose presence and contributions are valued” [6]. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=1&annotation=6W5W5527)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Belongingness has been found to be associated with attributes such as motivation [1], achievement [27], persistence [17] and student retention [25]. Known predictors of belongingness include race and gender [6, 11, 19]. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=1&annotation=ZRLM863J)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>It has been shown to vary across factors such as gender and minority status [24], and is known to play a role in the transition from second- to third-level education, and is likely influenced both by student characteristics (or what they ‘bring with them’) in addition to environmental factors [4]. It is likely that there are also many factors affecting sense of belonging that cannot be controlled for [11]. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=1&annotation=5VZGQN7P)) 


> [!background-literature]+ Background Literature  
>Schlesinger, Edwards &amp; Grinter [20] emphasised the need for research to recognise the intersections of diverse aspects of identities, including their race, gender, and class, but also other aspects such as nationality and/or sexuality [29], and intersectionality has been used to try and understand underrepresentation [26]. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=2&annotation=Z7GYG77B)) 


> [!methods]+ Methods  
>Belongingness was measured as the sum of positively framed question scores minus the sum of negatively-framed question scores. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=3&annotation=6ME5NUJJ))

> [!methods]+ Methods  
>We removed three students who did not respond to more than 10 questions. Twelve students had one missing answer and two students had two missing answers. It is likely that these questions were simply overlooked. For these we replaced the missing values with the mean Likert score for the question. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=3&annotation=V54HXLPN)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Identifying as a woman and identifying as a minority are weakly correlated with belief that success in computer science depends on inherent ability (r=0.17 and 0.18 respectively). ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=3&annotation=SNJHKKK5))

> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>It has been previously shown that female students who took part in student networking, mentoring and outreach outreach activities (“participation”) had a stronger sense of belonging compared to female students who did not [15]. However, we observed participation as only showing a very weak correlation with belongingness overall. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=4&annotation=MM7FYWAT)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Figure 3 shows the distribution of belongingness scores, calculated as the difference between the sum of the positively framed and the sum of the negatively framed sense of belonging questions, broken down by gender and whether students self-identified as a minority or not. ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=4&annotation=7XLWIIJJ)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Figure 3(c) shows that when students who self-identified as minorities are broken down by gender, belongingness is not significantly lower in self-identified male minorities ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=4&annotation=FD5KLA3N)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>However, the female students who self-identified as minorities (N = 29, M = 30, SD = 38) did have a significantly lower belongingness compared to female students that did not self-identify as being part of a minority ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=5&annotation=BHXBHWF2)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Confidence in mathematical abilities and enjoyment of problem solving are positively correlated (r=0.4) (Figure 1) and social interaction, problem solving ability, and mathematical ability are moderately correlated with belongingness (r=0.3, 0.2 and 0.3 respectively). ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=5&annotation=EXWAC3EU)) 


> [!results]+ Results / Discussion  
>Prior experience with computing appears to have a positive impact on male, but not female, students’ belongingness (Figure 5(a)). ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQT65GQC?page=6&annotation=PZ42UE2H))
