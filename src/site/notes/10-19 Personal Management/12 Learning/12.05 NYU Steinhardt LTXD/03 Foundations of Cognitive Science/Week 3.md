- this chapter examines the contributions of six disciplines to the study of knowledge: 
	- philosophy 
	- semiotics
	- linguistics
	- artificial intelligence
	- psychology
	- anthropology

## Philosophy

### Knowledge and reality: what's the connection? 
- start with the question: "what is real?"
- appearance and reality are not the same
#### Ontology: the philosophy of being
- ==ontology== is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of reality or being 
- what is real? are human beings material, or do we have immaterial souls? 
#### Plato's allegory of the cave 
- prisoners were chained inside of a cave, and they could only see the cave wall 
- their captors cast shadows of puppets on the wall, and the prisoners could make guesses about the nature of reality 
- one of the prisoners was released, and the sunlight was so bright that it temporarily blinded the man -- to examine reality directly was too much 
- but eventually he became accustomed to the light and was able to see reality more truly 
- he then understood that "what he had formerly seen was meaningless illusion"
#### Epistemology: how we know what we know
- ==epistemology==: the branch of philosophy concerned with what knowledge is, and how we know what we know
- ontology and epistemology connect to education in that one purpose of education is to reveal what is not obvious or apparent
#### Plato and Aristotle; Raphael's *The School of Athens*
- Raphael's painting depicts Aristotle and Plato as central figures
	- Plato's finger points upwards towards the heavens to indicate his conviction that ultimate reality is nonmaterial
	- Aristotle's palm is extended downward, toward the earth, to indicate his conviction that ultimate reality is in the physical world (empiricism)
 
### Empiricism and rationalism 
- during the Enlightenment, the two leading schools of epistemology where ==empiricism== (British Isles) and ==rationalism== (continental Europe)
#### Knowledge begins with experience
- three intellectuals established the philosophical school of empiricism: 
	- John Locke (1632-1704)
	- George Berkeley (1685-1753)
	- David Hume (1711-1776)
- they believed that knowledge begins with the senses; if not linked to the senses, knowledge is less certain 
- however, empiricists were aware that our senses can deceive us, which leads to the conclusion that we cannot directly access external reality
#### Knowledge begins with rational thought 
- Rene Descartes (1596-1650) knew that our senses cannot be completely trusted, and instead said that we should trust rational thought 
- however, he knew that rational thought and reasoning is not without fault either 
- the next step he took was to doubt everything: ==radical doubt==
- there was one fact that was for certain: that he exists. "Cogito ergo sum"
- from this fact, he derived the existence of God, and then the existence of mathematics

> [!note]
> It's interesting that these two schools of thought seem to carry forward the rivaling views of Plato and Aristotle on the nature of reality: rationalism joins Plato in the exaltation of the mind and rational thought as the only way to understand true reality, and empiricism echoes Aristotle's views that reality lies in the physical world and can be perceived through our senses

#### Kant's answer: the synthetic a priori
- Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) thought both empiricism and rationalism were incomplete
- to understand Kant's approach we need to know some terms:
	- ==analytic statements==: true by definition, e.g., A circle is round
	- ==synthetic statements==: true by discovery, not by definition, e.g., The earth is round
	- ==a priori==: "before the fact", refers to knowledge that we can have before discovery
	- ==a posteriori==: "after the fact", refers to knowledge we gain through discovery 
- Kant claimed that some synthetic knowledge is known before our experience of it, i.e. the category of ==synthetic a priori== knowledge, or built-in knowledge about space, time, and quantity, e.g., our understanding that tangible reality is composed of objects in 3D space
- this meant that empiricists and rationalists were both partly right because building knowledge partly relies on experience, and also relies on rational thought 
- inspired ==nativism==: the view that some knowledge is pre-learned and innate 

### Logical positivism
- ==logical positivism== was an intellectual movement in the early 20th century that held that only statements verifiable through direct observation or logical proof are meaningful in conveying truth value 
- inspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951)
#### The Vienna circle
- the Vienna Circle was a small group of logical positivist philosophers who met in Vienna, Austria during the 1920s and 1930s
- Wittgenstein decided that knowledge in the real world could never be tethered to solid foundations of certainty 
- the philosopher's perennial hope of certain knowledge was crushed and abandoned 

### The linguistic turn in philosophy 
- if certainty could not be obtained, what meaning could epistemology have? 
- Wittgenstein's answer was that knowledge and meaning are inextricably bound to language; he believed that the mental lives of humans are a function of the ideas they entertain in their own minds and those that are communicated socially
- this inspired the ==linguistic turn==, which is the focus of attention on language as a vehicle of knowledge rather than the physical world or the rational mind 
- language is still problematic and fails to capture much of the nature of knowledge, belief, and meaning, and also carries with it assumptions about norms for behavior and who has power in social relationships
	- Michel Foucault (1926-1984) illuminated the role of language in conveying power

## Semiotics

### Introduction
- ==semiotics== is the study of signs, which includes language but also any sound, image, or object that conveys meaning

### Ferdinand Saussure
#### The man forced to teach linguistics
- Ferdinand Saussure (1857-1913), was a Swiss linguist who was forced to teach a course in introductory linguistics 
- he used it to test some ideas that he had been entertaining for the past several years 
- his students took notes from his course, which became foundational for the field of semiotics
#### Signifier/signified
- Saussure looked at language in a completely new way
- his first insight was to change the perspective: rather than ask how language changes over time, he wondered how language functions at any one slice of time 
	- this led to a basic question: what is language? how does it relate to the thoughts we think? 
	- here, he made an important discovery: the sound of a spoken word and the meaning of the word are two very different things, and the relationship between a word's sound and its meaning is arbitrary 

> [!question] 
> What is the connection is to Baddeley's conception of the phonological loop / working memory? How does the working memory hold "meaning"?

-  next, he made a distinction between the ==signifier==, or the perceived sound/image, and the ==signified==, or the abstract concept or idea
	- together, the signifier and the signified constitute a ==sign==
	- ![Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 10.21.33 PM.png](/img/user/Screenshot%202023-09-17%20at%2010.21.33%20PM.png)
	- their relationship is arbitrary -- it is just a convention that is agreed upon by a society 
	- thus, the signifier can change over time, like how languages evolve 
- he extended this to other meaning systems, like gestures, facial expressions, traffic signals, etc.
	- this is the basis for ==semiotics==: the system of signs that, by convention, constitute the webs of meaning in any society 
#### La langue and parole
- he further distinguished between the system of signs that we are born into, and the specific use of signs when we speak
- ==la langue==, the system of signs, is stable -- it is difficult to change
- ==parole== are the specific uses of language, which lends itself to flexible use and perhaps-unlimited innovation 

### Charles Sanders Peirce 
- Peirce (1839-1914) was an American scientist 
- his model of signs was tripartite, whose parts were ==representamen==, a symbol; ==object==, a tangible object, and ==interpretant==, meaning (and also includes the cascade of associations triggered by the symbol)
	- this introduced the real-world referent of the sign, *the thing itself*
	- whether it should be included in the sign has been a hot topic of debate, and is connected to the philosopher's quest for certain knowledge: are ideas ultimately connected to tangible objects, or are they largely self-existent? 
- the modern linguist, Umberto Eco, critiqued the idea that signs should be connected to real-world referents
![[Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 10.34.18 PM.png \| 300]]
#### Interpretants
- Peirce's interpretant is any thought that is triggered, or signified, by a sign 
- this cascade can be infinite, and Peirce called this potential of signs ==unlimited semiosis==
- the notion of the interpretant sheds light on the meaning of a word used in education: understanding
	- it's helpful to think about understanding in terms of interpretants and semiosis 
- Umberto Eco's idea of a ==semantic universe==, which are all the signs of a culture 
	- educators might ask: what signs must we teach? what interpretants should be developed for those signs? 

## Linguistics

### What does language do? 
#### Sense and reference
- one similarity between linguistics and semiotics is the familiar question of whether knowledge is anchored in the tangible world or is relatively independent and self-existent
- there is a distinction between ==sense==: the intellectual meaning of a word and ==reference==: what the word indicates in the real world
	- however, what about words that don't have a real-world object associated with it, like *unicorn*? -- words that have sense, but no reference? 
- the point is that the sense/reference distinction clarifies that the words we use can have a definite shared sense, but two terms might have the same referent or no referent at all
	- the connection between our ideas and the tangible world is not direct or straightforward
#### Speech acts
- ==speech acts theory== presents the idea that language frequently accomplishes goals that have little or nothing to do with naming things 
	- language is a tool that we use to achieve our goals in a society
	- the ==pragmatic== function of language: the use of language to do things 

### Pre-wired for language 
#### The language acquisition device
- ==transformational grammars==: the rules that we use to change statements to questions, and questions to statements
- no one taught us how to make these changes, an observation that led Noam Chomsky to propose that our brains must be pre-wired to figure out how these transformational grammars work 
- this internal brain-based readiness is what Chomsky called the ==language acquisition device==, which is one expression of nativism 

### Does language make thought possible? 
#### Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
- the ==Sapir-Whorf hypothesis==: language does in fact shape and constrain thought
- one implication is that different language systems sometimes divide the world differently, and language has a role in how we see the world, and how we don't see the world 
- the hypothesis is probably true only to a limited degree

## Introduction 

- David Ausubel first introduced his ==theory of Meaningful Learning== in 1962 under the title "A Subsumption Theory of Meaningful Learning and Retention"
	- then expanded in 1963 in "The Psychology of Meaningful Verbal Learning"
	- then in 1968, in "Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View"

## Key principles of Ausubel's theory

- ==meaningful learning==: non-arbitrary, non-verbatim, substantive incorporation of new symbolically expressed ideas into cognitive structure; three requirements: 
	- the material to be learned must have potential meaning (e.g., not just a random string of words)
	- the learner must possess relevant concepts and propositions that can serve to anchor the new learning and assimilate new ideas
	- the learner must choose to relate the new information to their cognitive structure in a non-verbatim, substantive fashion
- ==rote learning==: arbitrary, verbatim, non-substantive incorporation of new ideas into cognitive structure; only recalled for a short amount of time; once forgotten, the traces may interfere with future learning 
- ==subsumption/subsumptive learning==: the process of incorporating new concepts and propositions into a hierarchically arranged framework in cognitive structure 
	- two types of subsumption
		- ==derivative==: new concepts or propositions are related to existing concepts or propositions but do not substantially alter their character or meaning
		- ==correlative==: new concepts or proposition expand the meaning of the existing concepts or propositions and confers new characteristics 
- ==combinatorial learning==: new concepts and propositions are seen as related to previous knowledge and cognitive structure, but the ideas are not subsumed under existing concepts or propositions
- ==representational learning==: the identification of ideas that they understand with appropriate symbolic labels
- ==superordinate learning==: new concepts are acquired that have a superordinate relationship with existing concepts and propositions; can serve to interrelate previously held concepts that were not seen as connected in meaning 
	- superordinate learning is unusually powerful in developing cognitive organization, which is characteristic of people who possess expert knowledge in the domain 
	- also important in creative production, since ideas may be related in new combinations with powerful new meanings
- ==obliterative subsumption==: the process that begins in meaningful learning where new meanings are modified as they are incorporated into cognitive structure
	- this can lead over time to the failure to recall specific new concepts or propositions previously subsumed
	- however, unlike the forgetting that occurs after rote learning, the failure to recall does not interfere with future learning, and the cognitive restructuring that occurred int he process may facilitate new related learning
- two ideas to describe the changes in cognitive structure as a consequence of meaningful learning 
	- ==progressive differentiation==: concept meanings are gradually clarified and hierarchical organization of concepts and prepositions is improved
	- ==integrative reconciliation==: explicit delineation of similarities and differences between related ideas is achieved 

## Ausubel and Piaget

- how are Ausubel's ideas similar or different from Piaget's key ideas of assimilation, accommodation, and equilibration? 
- first, Ausubel's theory deals with cognitive learning and how specific concepts and propositions are incorporated into the learner's cognitive structure
	- Piaget's developmental theory deals with changes in generic cognitive capacities characterized by the stages of forms of thinking: sensory motor (0-2 years), preoperational (2-7 years), concrete operational (7-14 years), formal operational (14+ years)
	- ==assimilation==: new information is assimilated into these general structures of schemata
		- ==schema==: "a cognitive structure which has reference to a class of similar action sequences, these sequences of necessity being strong, bounded totalities in which the constituent behavioral elements are tightly interrelated"
	- ==accommodation==: leads to some modification of existing schema; inseparable from assimilation
	- ==equilibration==: the process of successive experiences leading to new further assimilations and accommodations
- in the author's work, they see the fundamental cognitive limitation of children as derived primarily from the sparsity of their concept and prepositional frameworks, not from limited brain mechanisms

## Ausubel's theory applied to instruction

- in Ausubel's early writing, he made the distinction between reception learning and discovery learning
	- ==reception learning==: when concepts and propositions are presented to learners for incorporation into cognitive structure 
	- ==discovery learning==: when the learner identifies the content and relationships to be learned and constructs the propositional ideas independently 
- two continua:
	- rote learning <-> meaningful learning
	- reception learning <-> discovery learning
	- ![Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 1.07.17 AM.png|300](/img/user/Screenshot%202023-09-19%20at%201.07.17%20AM.png)
- ==advance organizers==: instruction should be organized in such a way that more general concept or propositional material is introduced in a concise fashion prior to more specific less inclusive propositional material 
	- the general introduction will serve to anchor into cognitive structure more specific information 

## The changing epistemological landscape

historical trends in epistemology: 
- since 1620, Francis Bacon's (1620) ideas on the nature of rational inquiry have informed the scientific method 
- in 1900, Karl Pearson continued the development of science in his *Grammar of Science*
- thus, logical positivism and empiricism dominated the thinking of scholars interested in knowledge and knowledge production
- beginning in 1940, scientists began to turn to philosophical issues
	- Conant's *On Understanding Science* (1947)
	- Thomas Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* (1962)
- from the 1960s, new (but still largely positivist) ideas emerged from:
	- Toulmin's (1972) *Human Understanding*
	- Rorty (1979)
	- Popper (1982)
	- Watson (1985)
	- Miller (1987)
- in the 1990s, a period of "post-positivism"
implications for psychology and education:
- shift from behaviorism to constructivism
	- individuals construct their own meanings and the construction of new meanings is dependent on the prior knowledge
- Von Glasersfeld's (1984) radical constructivism: knowledge is continuously evolving and ultimate truths will not be known 
- D. Bob Gowin's investigation into the lack of understanding by students of the nature of scientific inquiry and the relationship between laboratory work they were doing and the construction of knowledge 
	- in 1977, invented a heuristic device to express the relationship between conceptual/theoretical ideas and methodological elements formed in the construction of knowledge 
	- Gowin's Vee
	- ![Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 9.05.25 AM.png|300](/img/user/Screenshot%202023-09-19%20at%209.05.25%20AM.png)
- important in contemporary epistemology: the role that feels and values play in questioning and in construction of knowledge claims
	- sees knowledge-making as highly emotion- and value-laden 
- Novak's focus is on the nature of the learning process as a basis for understanding the process of knowledge construction 
	- human constructivism

## Current status of assimilation theory

- Novak's research group began to apply Ausubel's assimilation ideas in 1964 to the design of instructional programs and science programs
	- findings supported the validity of the theory, but suggested some modifications
- development of the concept mapping approach
	- came from a necessity for a better way to explicitly represent cognitive structure changes
- shift towards the idea that limitations in conceptual understanding and problem solving were primarily determined by the adequacy of relevant conceptual frameworks, not by cognitive operational stages as proposed by Piaget 
	- based on the longitudinal study with young children, six-year old children were capable of understanding abstract science concepts at reasonably high levels
- what happens when learners have no relevant concepts or propositions? 
	- this is unlikely to be the case for any normal children beyond age three 
	- but existing concepts may be so general or limited in relevance that rote learning could be more efficient in early stages 
 
> [!question]
> If all knowledge is built on prior concepts or propositions, where does the first bit of knowledge come from? 

- another consideration is the recognition that human memory systems are not a single system but at least three systems: perceptual or sensory memory, short-term or working memory, long-term memory
	- as Miller pointed out in 1956, working memory is limited in the number of "chunks" it can process at once
	- since meaning making occurs in the working memory, there are severe limitations that must be recognized in instructional design and in the organization of knowledge 
	- heuristics like concept maps and Vee diagrams serve as a kind of "conceptual jig" to hold in place chunks of related knowledge that must be processed sequentially due to the limitations of working memory
		- they allow an individual to "hold in place" conceptual elements that are needed for new meaning making, especially in the case of major conceptual integrative reconciliations or in superordinate learning
		- they also serve as advance organizers to show comprehensive concept/propositional relationships, while allowing for clear assimilation of subordinate ideas into the framework
- the authors see metacognitive instruction utilizing the tools of concept mapping and Vee diagramming as indispensable for achieving high levels of meaningful learning for the majority of students 
	- these tools can also be used for evaluation, transcending many problems educators face in "authentic" evaluation
	-
