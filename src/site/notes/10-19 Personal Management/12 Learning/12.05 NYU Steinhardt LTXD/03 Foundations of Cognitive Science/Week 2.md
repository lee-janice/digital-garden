# Martinez, M. E. (2010). The cognitive architecture. In Learning and Cognition: The Design of the Mind (pp. 36–75). Boston: Merrill.

- Behaviorism proved to be an incomplete theory. 
- Neobehaviorists proposed that characteristics of organisms must be taken into account to understand behavior. 
- Simultaneously, computers began to rise in popularity and formed the question: Is the human mind like a computer? 

## The computer metaphor

### The human mind is like a computer

- Memory: Computers and minds both have short-term and long-term memory. 
- Transformation of information: They both transform information, i.e., perform computation. 
- Open system: They both interact with the external world; both receive input from the outside and use that information in some form of output. 

### The human mind is not like a computer 

- Purpose, values, emotions, personality
- Consciousness: the self-awareness that we exist

> [!note] 
> This is the [Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson%E2%80%93Shiffrin_memory_model)

## The sensory register

- Information flows along three human memory structures: the sensory register, short-term/working memory, and long-term memory
	- The sensory register: the shortest-term element of memory where information is stored just long enough to be transferred to short-term memory, e.g., the detailed "raw data" from perception 
	- Information only lasts about 2 seconds 

## Short-term/working memory 

- Short-term memory is the cognitive function that corresponds to your awareness
- Small capacity: The human mind can store about seven pieces of information at once 
	- George Miller, "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two"
- Short duration: Conscious thoughts are only briefly the focus of attention
	- What we think about is "not much for not long"
	- You can override the short duration by intense concentration and hold an idea in short-term memory for a while 
- Alan Baddeley proposed that the function of short-term memory is not just storage, but it's the cognitive resource responsible for mental work (i.e., enables computation)
	- Working memory: short-term information storage + mental work 
- Evidence for claiming that working memory does mental work:
	- The storage capacity of working memory is affected by whether or not work is done on that information -- more work means less capacity for storage

### Teaching with working memory in mind

- Don't overwhelm students' working memory, because its capacity is limited; information should be structured with respect to this capacity. Cooperate with the design of the mind

## Long-term memory

- Long-term memory is the warehouse of the mind, and has a very large capacity 

### Multimodal LTM 

- Dual coding theory: 
	- proposed by psychologist Allan Paivio in 1986
	- recognizes language and mental imagery as two dominant forms of knowledge used by the mind 
- Mental imagery is something like vision, but is less precise 
	- It also includes mental experiences from other senses, like sound, smell, and taste 

### A fully cross-referenced encyclopedia

- Herbert Simon's (1980) insight is that long-term memory is a fully cross-referenced encyclopedia, meaning that it is a large collection of encyclopedic information 
- Ideas are linked by meaning
	- All mental knowledge is directly connectable to all similar ideas 
- Multimedia/hypermedia
	- Multimedia: the integration of information in different modes
	- Hypermedia: the direct connectivity of related ideas through mouse clicks 

### Episodic memory 

- Episodic memory is reliving personal experiences 
- There is no evidence that the brain stores memories of events exactly as they occurred (as previously proposed by Wilder Penfield, who probed patients' temporal lobes with electrical stimulation and found that they relived past experiences); rather, memory is highly selective and subject to interpretation and distortion

## Summarizing the cognitive architecture 

- This cognitive model is an information-processing model

##  Basic cognitive processes

The information-processing model
![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 7.04.56 PM.png \| 500]]

- Cognitive processes have different qualities as information moves through the cognitive system.
- **Sensation** is the brief recording of environmental stimuli in the sensory register
	- William James (1890) for an infant, the world is little more than a "blooming, buzzing confusion"
- **Perception** is the cognitive act of imposing order on sensory data as it enters working memory
	- Gestalt principles of perception 
		- The Gestalt psychologists of the early 20th century noted that our mind often fills in gaps to perceive a pattern that is more "whole" than the raw data, called a "Gestalt" (meaningful whole)
		- Phi phenomenon: if you arrange two lights, one above the other, and turn them on alternately, the mind sees one light moving up and down rather than two blinking lights
	- Relates to constructivism — the philosophy that the mind is actively making sense of the world — and reveals that this active role extends all the way down to the simplest acts of perception
	- Perception takes place in all three memory systems
		- In long-term memory, bottom-up processing (using basic sensory information to activate a known concept in long-term memory) and top-down processing (using knowledge to fill in missing details in sensory experience) occurs 
- **Attention** is holding information in conscious awareness in working memory
	- Managing one's attention involves focusing on certain information and ignoring others, which is influenced by our goals and prior knowledge and interest
	- Cocktail party phenomenon: the ability to maintain focus on a single conversation in a room where dozens of other conversations are taking place
	- Attention is constrained by the limited capacity of working memory 
	- You can control your attention through metacognition: a form of higher-order thinking 
- **Learning** is moving information from temporary working memory to enduring long-term memory
	- Write time parameter: time is needed for temporary information to be stored in LTM
	- Rehearsal: the strategy of repetition to learn information
	- Depth of processing: the more thorough the connections between new knowledge and prior knowledge, the better the learning outcome
		- Type I elaboration: connections to prior knowledge are minimal (e.g., repeating a phone number, memorization)
		- Type II elaboration: connections are strong
			- Generation effect: when learners integrate information to form new products, the information becomes more memorable
- **Remembering** is moving information from long-term memory back into working memory
	- Recall vs. recognition: recall is harder, recognition is easier 
	- Information cues can help make remembering more likely 
- **Knowing** is holding knowledge in long-term memory

## The funnel of information 

- As the information flows through the information-processing system, there is a pattern: as it moves from outside in, less and less of it is used by the cognitive system. 

### Decreasing subsets of information 

- Sensation: the amount of information that we sense is enormous, and is briefly held in the sensory register 
- Perception: the patterns perceived are a subset of the data sensed 
- Attention: we perceive many patterns, but can only pay attention to a few items at a time
- Learning: only a fraction of the things we pay attention to is recorded in LTM

### External memory

- External memory: memory that lies outside the brain (e.g., notes)
- External memory can compensate for shortcomings of the human cognitive system 
- In many instances, cognition is thought of as a property of groups of people interacting with technical features of their environment 
	- Activities of individual minds are meaningful only in a larger context of valued cultural activities 

## Chunking and Automaticity 

- The small capacity of working memory is an information-processing bottleneck 
- How can we resolve this limited capacity with great human achievements?

### Chunking 

- Chunk: a pattern of meaningful information 
- Chunking allows working memory to hold more information given the same capacity 
- The process of chunking reveals part of how a novice develops into an expert
- In any knowledge domain, experience leads to familiarity with recurring patterns, and this cognitive simplification makes a complex concept seem simpler 
- Familiar/expert knowledge makes it easier for concepts to flow between working and long-term memory 

## Automaticity

- Declarative knowledge: factual knowledge
- Procedural knowledge: how to do things 
- chunking : declarative knowledge :: automaticity : procedural knowledge
- Activities become easier with time and experience 
- Declarative vs. procedural knowledge reveals point of contention in educational philosophy: whether schools should concentrate on basic skills or on higher-level thinking (even if they go hand in hand)

## Laws of learning

### Serial position curve

- Learning is not linear—it can proceed along multiple fronts and at different and varying rates, but it does take place in the linear dimension of time
- Serial position curve: the ideas presented near the beginning and the end are usually the most memorable 
	- ![Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.31.26 PM.png|300](/img/user/Screenshot%202023-09-10%20at%208.31.26%20PM.png)
	- Primacy effect: boost to ideas presented first
	- Recency effect: boost to the ideas presented last
	- The U-shape results from interference: when information X makes learning information Y more difficult 
		- In the beginning or end, there is no prior/subsequent information to interfere with learning

### Encoding specificity 

- learned (encoded) material is linked to (is specific to) the context in which it is learned 
	- e.g., people who learn a list of words underwater remember it best when they are back in water
- This can include emotional context: mood-congruent processing
- This tells us that the mind is highly associational 

### Massed and distributed practice 

- Massed practice: combining all study time into a single session
- Distributed practice: spreading learning into numerous sessions 
- Learning is more efficient with distributed practice 

## Learning strategies 

1. Focus working memory
2. "Chunk" information 
3. Identify the most important ideas
4. Seek automaticity for some skills
5. Divide study time into several sessions
6. Capitalize on primacy and recency effects
7. Encode in multiple modes
8. Link to prior knowledge
9. Learn to self-cue for retrieval 
10. Question what you think you know

# Baddeley, A. (1992). [Working memory](https://brightspace.nyu.edu//content/enforced/305215-FA23_EDCT-GE_2174_1_003/Readings/Baddeley%20-%201992%20-%20Working%20memory.pdf?isCourseFile=true&ou=305215). _Science_, 255(5044), 556–559.

- Working memory can be divided into three subcomponents:
	- the central executive, an attentional-controlling system
	- the visuospatial sketchpad, which manipulates visual images
	- the phonological loop, which stores and rehearses speech-based information, necessary for the acquisition of both native and second-language vocabulary

## Introduction

- key question in the 1960s: whether memory should be regarded as a single unitary system, or whether it should be separated into subsystems
	- evidence accumulated in favor of a dichotomy, such as that proposed by [Atkinson and Shiffrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson%E2%80%93Shiffrin_memory_model) 
	- but this model ran into difficulties
		- e.g., Atkinson and Shiffrin suggested that the short-term store within their model acted as a working memory; if that were the case, one would expect patients with a defective short-term store to show many other cognitive problems, including impaired long-term learning
		- however, these patients demonstrated surprisingly few cognitive handicaps
- Baddeley attempted to simulate short-term memory deficits by using a dual-task technique, arguing that if remembering a sequence of digits relies on the short-term store, working memory should be hindered if the subject is required to remember digits while performing other cognitive tasks
	- as the concurrent digit load is increased, the short-term capacity would decrease and interference would increase
	- reasoning, comprehension, and learning tasks showed a similar pattern: as digit load increased, performance declined, but far less than predicted
- thus, they abandoned the idea of a unitary short-term store that also functions as a working memory 
- instead, they propose the tripartite system: central executive, phonological loop, and visuospatial sketchpad

## Components of working memory 

- research suggests that the primary function of working memory is the coordination of resources

## The subsystems of working memory 

- the [dual-task paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-task_paradigm) has been used to demonstrate the separability of the memory systems responsible for learning via visuospatial imagery and via rote repetition

> [!note]  Dual-coding theory
> [Dual-coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-coding_theory) suggests that the mind processes information along two different channels: visual and verbal

## Analyzing the phonological loop 

- ==phonological loop==: 
	- the simplest and most extensively investigated component of working memory
	- two components: a phonological store that can hold acoustic or speech-based information for 1-2 seconds, and an articulatory control process, analogous to inner speech
	- two functions: maintain material within the phonological store by subvocal repetition, and take visually presented material such as words or nameable pictures and register them in the phonological store by subvocalization
- laboratory-based findings:
	- the acoustic similarity effect: immediate ordered recall of items is worse when they are similar in sound (e.g., map, mat, man, cap, cat)
	- the irrelevant speech effect: the reduction in recall of lists of visually presented items brought about by the presence of irrelevant spoken material (which gain access to the phonological memory store)
	- the word-length effect: memory span for words is inversely related to the spoken duration of words
	- articulatory suppression: the disruption of the use of subvocal rehearsal by requiring subjects to repeat some irrelevant sound, like the word "the", which prevents subjects from rehearsing the material they are trying to remember and prevents them from registering visually presented material in the phonological store 

## The function of the phonological loop

- the phonological store serves as a backup system for comprehension of speech under taxing conditions, but may be less important with simple, clearly presented material 
- another possible function is for native-language learning: short-term phonological storage is important for new long-term phonological learning
