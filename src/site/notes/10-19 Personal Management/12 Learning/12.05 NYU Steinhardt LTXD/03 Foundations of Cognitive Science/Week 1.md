# Discussion 

> Behaviorism
> Do you think behaviorism (rewards and punishments) explains all learning? Can you think of examples of things you've learned both with and without influence of rewards and punishment?

I think that behaviorism plays an important role in some types of learning, especially of "intuitive" and subconscious associations between stimuli and consequences, but I don't believe that it can explain all learning, especially since it doesn't account for the role that the mind can play in the learning process. For example, someone doesn't have to experience an outcome to learn that X causes Y — they could also learn this association from reading about it in a textbook. Additionally, even if all _behavior_ could be explained with behaviorism (which seems doubtful), it doesn't seem to me that it could explain all _learning,_ like how people learn abstract concepts like language or mathematics, or how they form mental representations of the world. 

I feel like a lot of what I've learned through behaviorism/reward and punishment has actually been unhealthy for me (outside of more basic/survival-based things like touching fire == getting hurt), and I almost suspect that it hijacked my brain circuitry to make me addicted to or fear certain outcomes... like validation by teachers for doing well on a test, or fear of getting bad grades in school. A lot of this had to be "unlearned" once I got out of the K-12 school system! 

It's tricky (as other people have noted) to think of things that I haven't learned with the influence of rewards or punishment, since even if something is "intrinsically-motivated", you still probably do it in order to feel a certain way or to produce a certain outcome, which could be seen as a reward? So I feel like it might be important to make a distinction between "why people learn" (motivation for learning) and "how people learn" (mechanisms for learning) — behaviorism might govern a lot of the former but not much of the latter. If we're talking about the mechanisms of learning, then rewards and punishments haven't influenced how I've learned (as mentioned above) abstract concepts, or even concrete facts: it's only influenced how I've learned these basic or "experiential" associations between actions and outcomes.

#  Martinez, M. E. (2010). Introduction. In Learning and Cognition: The Design of the Mind

## Four paradigms

1. ==behaviorism==
2. ==cognitive information-processing theory==
	- how the human mind processes information 
	- interdisciplinary perspectives on how the mind works
	- higher-order mental processes that seem to set humans apart from other species
	- how emotional and motivational states influence learning
	- how cognition changes over the lifespan 
3. ==neuroscience==
	- biology's effect on cognition 
	- connections between thought processes and brain structures
4. ==psychometric theory==
	- measuring qualities of the mind along particular dimensions
	- measuring differences among learners and implications for teaching
	- competing theories of intelligence 

## Where does education take place?

- education extends into multiple life contexts, including the home and the larger community 

## What exactly is education?

- John Dewey in *Experience and Education* (1938)
	- to be educational, an experience has to meet the criteria of continuity 
	- **continuity**: the potential of an experience to live on profitably in the future 
	- the acquisition of static knowledge is unlikely to meet this criterion 
- outcomes of education 
	- ==conceptual knowledge==
	- ==procedural knowledge==
	- ability to think well; cognitive capacities (problem solving, creativity, critical thinking)
	- ability to experience feelings like curiosity and wonder
	- capacity to pursue goals purposefully and with perseverance

## The design of the educational experience

- in the mid 20th century, many researchers studied which teacher practices would bring about desirable student outcomes (process-product research)
	- this emphasis emerged from behaviorism
	- the most important leverage point was assumed to be teacher actions
### How do learners learn?
- towards the end of the 20th century, ed research shifted its attention to the learner
	- informed by the cognitive revolution in psychology
	- it now informs what teaching/learning/thinking/education are about
- complexity of educational outcomes could rise to the complexity of the human mind
###  The design of the mind
- key question of this textbook is what is the design of the mind, and what does this design imply for education?

## Why study behavior? 

- ==Behaviorism== is the study of learning in humans and animals through behavior rather than thoughts or feelings 
- The behaviorist is interested only in what can be observed directly
### Advantages and disadvantages of behaviorism
- Advantage: by focusing strictly on behavior and on objective explanations for behavior, the methodology of behaviorism appears to be scientific
- Disadvantage: learning is essentially cognitive 

## Classical conditioning

- To a behaviorist, conditioning is a synonym for learning, which refers to a change in behavior
### Ivan Pavlov's discovery
- the Russian scientist, Ivan Pavlov, discovered classical conditioning
	- a conditioned stimulus (footsteps) led to a conditioned response (salivation); as opposed to an unconditioned stimulus (food) provoking an unconditioned response (salivation)
	- Pavlov called the learned behavior in his studies ==conditioned reflexes==
- ==classical conditioning== explains how a neutral (conditioned) stimulus can evoke the same response as a natural (unconditioned) stimulus through learning
	- it entails ==stimulus substitution==, where the conditioned stimulus substitutes for the unconditioned stimulus
	- the conditioned stimulus has to occur before the unconditioned stimulus, and the association is strongest if it occurs just an instant before the unconditioned stimulus
### Why is classical conditioning important? 
- many forms of primitive behavior is classically conditioned, e.g., the fight or flight response
	- a neutral stimulus can evoke the same primitive behavior as a natural stimulus

## Early behaviorism in America

- behaviorism dominated American psychology from 1920-1970
### John B. Watson: Psychology as a science
- in the 1913 article, "Psychology as the Behaviorist Sees It", Watson argues that behaviorism is the only appropriate psychology 
- he demonstrated how behaviorism applied to humans through the ==Little Albert== experiment, where he conditioned a baby to fear fluffy white objects by associating a loud banging noise with a white rat
	- ==stimulus generalization== is expansion beyond the original stimulus
	- ==stimulus discrimination== is perceiving the difference between two stimuli so that one evokes a response and the other does not
- to Watson, behaviorism was a powerful means to alter human behavior; he believed that every person is conditioned by the events of a unique life path, and that human behavior is highly malleable (nurture over nature)

## Classical conditioning and education

- classical conditioning shows how a neutral stimulus can evoke a behavioral response, or more importantly, strong emotional reactions 
	- this is important because emotions can influence our goals and aspirations, and what we believe is possible to achieve
- however, there are limitations: classical conditioning explains only simple behavior 
### E.L. Thorndike: Instrumental conditioning
- Thorndike used the word ==instrumental conditioning==, but his ideas influenced the development of ==operant conditioning==
- he put a cat inside of a puzzle box, and the cat had to pull a lever in order to escape
	- he wanted to see if the cat could escape
	- the cat flailed around and through its random behavior, managed to accidentally hit the lever and escape, and Thorndike fed it a treat
	- => random behavior (rather than insight) can sometimes lead to results that are beneficial to the organism
 
> [!note]
> Reminds me of random mutation in natural selection 

- gradually, the cat became more efficient at escaping the box
- ==**the law of effect**==: any behavior that is followed by rewards is more likely to be repeated than behavior that is not followed by rewards
	- shows how random activity, rather than insightful understanding, can lead to effective behavior
### B.F. Skinner: Operant conditioning
- In 1938, formulated the S-S-R paradigm: stimulus -> response -> reinforcement 
- ==reinforcement== is any consequence that leads to the repetition of a behavior
shaping through ==successive approximations==: 
	- when a person or animal learns a new "trick" through operant conditioning, the new behavior is typically learned gradually (Skinner, 1951)
	- at first, the behavior only approximates the ultimate pattern in a coarse way 
	- through rewarding attempts that better approximate the target behavior, it eventually reaches the ultimate goal 

> [!note]
> These principles show up in machine learning, e.g., reinforcement learning; minimizing the loss function

- ==shaping== describes the actions of a trainer or teacher to evoke more effective behavior over time
- ==operant==: a behavior that is generated by the animal, which has a random element 
	- within the scope of possible behaviors, only a fraction of those random behaviors (operants) had any positive effect; thus, the scope of random operants tapered down over time 
	- therefore, in Skinner's theory, there is a definite role for random behavior as the raw material for eventual complex behavior 
- there are parallels between Skinner's theory of operant conditioning and Darwin's theory of natural selection
	- importance of random variation as the raw material for changes in organisms 
	- normally, conditioned behavior is not passed on to subsequent generations, except in human beings (through education)
	- like Darwin with biological phenomena, Skinner thought that his theory was capable of explaining all behavioral phenomena — it was meant to be a "totalizing" theory
teaching complex behavior: 
- Skinner also thought that these principles could be used to control human behavior 
- ==behavioral modification== is any systematic approach to teaching new behavior using the principles of operant conditioning 
- ==punishment== is also a significant factor, making behaviors less likely instead of more likely 
- types of stimuli:
	- ==positive reinforcement==: adding positive stimulus
	- ==negative reinforcement==: removing negative stimulus
	- ==positive punishment==: adding negative stimulus 
	- ==negative punishment==: removing positive stimulus 
### Reinforcement schedules
- how does the timing of reinforcement affect conditioning? 
- ==continuous reinforcement==: reinforcement is given every time the behavior occurs 
- ==four kinds of reinforcement schedules==: 
	- fixed ratio: one reinforcement for a fixed number of behaviors
	- variable ratio: one reinforcement for a random number of behaviors
	- fixed interval: one reinforcement per a fixed amount of time
	- variable interval: one reinforcement per a random amount of time 
- variable ratio reinforcement is more powerful than the others -- if rewards come occasionally and unpredictably, the individual is most likely to maintain new behavior for a long time
- continuous reinforcement is most effective for establishing new behavior 

## Behaviorism's enduring impact

### Impact on education 
- positive reinforcement is ubiquitous in education, e.g., praise
- Skinner opposed punishment, partly because he believed it wasn't as effective as using or withholding reinforcement
- Skinner (1958) applied operant conditioning to education
	- lead to ==teaching machines==, precursors to computer-based learning systems
	- the strategy was to break down the learning goals into units and order them from least to most difficult 
	- the teaching machine presented students with new information and assessed their learning, giving them immediate feedback 
	- if the student got the question correct, it would move to a more difficult topic
- ==programmed instruction==: the breakdown of material and expected student responses into specific and discrete units and sequences
- ==behavioral objectives==: when goals of learning are expressed in terms of objective behavior 
- ==mastery learning==: acknowledged that students learn at different rates; accommodated those different rates by breaking down content of teaching into prescribed blocks and allowing students flexibility in the time needed to master a block of instruction 
### Impact on parenting
- many reinforcement techniques are used by parents, like praising children or "timeout"
### Impact on social philosophy
- Skinner's theory implies that humans are neither good nor evil; human behavior is simply the result of past reinforcement or punishment patterns in each person's experience, which implies determinism
- Skinner (1971) Beyond Freedom and Dignity
- Skinner (1948) Walden Two, a utopian society with peaceful coexistence through reinforcement of positive behavior, but the society is manipulative and robotic

## Behaviorism challenged

### Circular definition of reinforcement 
- reinforcement is defined in terms of its effects (increasing or decreasing the likelihood of behavior repeating)
- however, this definition makes it impossible to test the idea that reinforcement causes behavior to be repeated; it is an assumption
### Edward Tolman: Rats with purpose
- Edward Tolman's 1932 experiments suggested that the behavior of rats could not be explained fully by behaviorist principles of stimulus and response
- they involved experiments on how rats learned to navigate mazes; rats could adapt when the maze was blocked by choosing an alternative but efficient route
	- Tolman could not escape the feeling that the rats navigated the mazes as if they had a "mental map" of the maze structure: a cognitive concept, not a behaviorist one
	- they also appeared to run the mazes with a sense of purpose/a goal that guided their actions
	- thus, his ideas were also called ==purposive behaviorism==
- Tolman write *Purposive Behavior in Man and Animals* in 1932
- ==neobehaviorists== began to emerge, who felt that it was necessary to consider the internal characteristics of the organism
	- basic paradigm of neobehaviorists: Stimulus -> Organism -> Response
	- showed that a stimulus does not directly produce a response; traits of the organism (drive, purpose, strength of stimulus-response associations (habit strength)) influenced the response
	- helped pave the way to cognitive theories
### Noam Chomsky: Language acquisition device
- Chomsky noted that humans are biologically programmed to learn language
	- for example, speakers can easily transform statements into questions, and questions into statements, but people aren't directly taught how 
	- people infer syntax from patterns of everyday speech; experience with language gives humans not only knowledge of words, but also a sense of the underlying logic or structure of language 
- it was inconceivable to Chomsky that this ability arises through the stimulus-response-reinforcement mechanism 
- he directly criticized behaviorism in his 1959 review of Skinner's book *Verbal Behavior*, which some see as the watershed between behaviorism and the new era of cognitive psychology
- launched the ==nativism== movement in psychology, which recognized that the human brain has some innate knowledge—unlearned ways of understanding the world and acting upon it 
### Albert Bandura: Learning through imitation
- he believed that firsthand experiences were not always necessary for learning to occur—human beings are highly capable of observing the behavior of other people and imitating that behavior 
- his ==social learning theory== recognized the major role of observation and imitation in learning; learning can occur through social observation
- he added the concept of ==self-efficacy== beliefs: a person's sense of their own capability

## Is there a downside to behaviorism? 

### Undermining intrinsic motivation
- what would happen if reinforcement were applied when people enjoyed the activity prior to conditioning? 
	- Mark Lepper and his colleagues tested this in 1973
	- children were intrinsically motivated to play with Magic Markers for their own sake
	- they were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 
		- "expected award" group, who were promised a "Good Player Award" if they agreed to make drawings for the researcher 
		- "unexpected award" group, who were given the award even though they were not promised one
		- "no award" group, who didn't know about the award and weren't given one
	- researchers measured how long the children played with the Magic Markers after they were no longer associated with a promised award: the "expected award" group decreased their free play with the markers while the other two showed no difference, and their drawings were judged to be of lower quality than the other two groups 
### The negative effects of extrinsic rewards
- other studies also confirmed that extrinsic rewards could undermine initial intrinsic interest in an activity 
- operant conditioning is strongly based on the use of extrinsic rewards 
- but intrinsic motivation is universally recognized as an important learning outcome; it can sustain longterm learning 

## Learning strategies

> [!question]
> In what learning situations should behaviorism be applied? I feel like I'm a bit biased against it (because of its possible negative effects), but are there situations where a behaviorist approach is necessary? Maybe to reinforce "basic" principles / behaviors / habits? I'm not so sure about its application to more abstract concepts, though.

1. Avoid associating learning with negative emotions
2. Associate learning with positive emotions
3. Use continuous reinforcement to initiate new behavior
4. Tailor reinforcement to the individual
5. Be careful not to reinforce undesired behavior
6. Reduce reinforcement after the new behavior becomes establsihed
7. Switch to random reinforcement to make the new behavior robust
8. Be careful of the undermining effects of extrinsic rewards
9. Use unanticipated rewards
10. Use cognitive concepts
