## Feedback 

### From Xavier 

Great initial design!  It is bold and attractive.  It immediately call the attention of the viewer.
_**Positive points**_: Great uses of the layout and composition principles.  It is clean and it is able to absorb a lot of information.  
_**Things to improve:**_ Just one thing, it is not immediately clear that the menu is a menu.  You should play a little bit with its position / size.  Nothing else really at this point.  Good work!

### From PeerStudio 

- I noticed that the text is large so that the audience can know that it's there and that the color indicates where you are in the page and the pages for the content is there and I can understand what's going on.
- Janice, this looks like a really cool project! I appreciate that you went outside your comfort zone to push some boundaries! While the "CS for Whom?" header is consistent with the sizing of the other pages, I do feel like it is competing with the triangle for attention. You might also play around with trying a smaller font size for the categories in the triangle. I love a good triangle, but it always feels like the longest word always goes in the smallest section! One other question I have is if, on the second page, the header is meant to say "Data," instead of "Capacity." If it's a sub-page within the Data section, maybe that could be shown somewhere or otherwise somehow indicated. I'm excited to see how this evolves! I really like the simplicity that the contrast affords, as well as the consistency with the triangle shape.
- First of all, I think this is such a cool idea. I love how you used this as an opportunity to connect our schoolwork to our job. I really appreciate the use of red to signify which page the user is on. I know this is just the wireframe, but I think this is a really effective method to continue using! The pyramid is a great visual and I am impressed by your use of scale, spacing, and typography. I also think the charts are a great format for this display of information. I love the tension built with the dramatic use of scale. To maintain a form of unity, though, I wonder what it would look like if the “More on CS4All Initiative, the Research Alliance, and this tool” on the third wireframe were aligned underneath the “About.” I think it could compliment the menu options on the left side. As previously mentioned, I think the spacing is generally visually appealing. If not done so already, I wonder how using the golden proportion as a framework would influence the design. It could bring everything together really nicely. You noted the use of triangular symbols to indicate drop-down menus, which I love. I wonder how else you can utilize the pyramid throughout the design? Maybe there are ways to feature it in subtle ways. I think it’s a really fun shape to play around with!
- I think it's great the you had the goal of pushing yourself out of your comfort zone on this! The typography is very strong and feels intentional with how bold it is. I also like that you used the red text to show where is user is within the available tabs. I would be interested in seeing how other colors might tie into the functionality of the page as well - the black/white/red work very well, but I think some pops of color throughout the page would provide even more contrast. Awesome work!

# Discussion 

## The Creative Process

> Most of you should be familiar with design thinking (Check [this website](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812) if not) How the graphic design creative process is similar or different from the design thinking process?  Comment and give examples.

I'm not very intimately familiar with design thinking (yet!), but my impression so far is that design thinking is a generalized form of the graphic design creative process — i.e., that the graphic design (GD) creative process is a specific instance or application of the design thinking (DT) process. I say this because it seems that all of the elements of the GD process can be mapped onto the DT one; for example, using the double diamond framework: 

- Research → Discover / Define 
- Ideation → Develop
- Production → Deliver.

However, the DT process appears to be applicable to *any* type of design project, whether it be graphic design, product design, industrial design, etc. 

Also, the DT process defines more abstract mechanisms for each phase (like converging / diverging, designing the right thing > designing things right), whereas the GD process emphasizes concrete practices, such as creative briefs, mind maps / mood boards, and wireframes.

It then seems to me like the DT process provides the *mindset* or *theoretical framework* with which to approach design projects, whereas the GD process is a *practical* application of this mindset to graphic design problems. 

## Layout and Composition 

>In this topic, please answer the following questions:
> - Can you recognize these principles in the designs around you (advertisement, websites, product design)? Be as specific as possible.  Include images (or link to images).
> - How can these principles make your learning design better?

I chose these two books as my examples, because they are books that I very admittedly judged and purchased by their covers! The layout and design of the covers (especially on the spines) definitely caught my eye and made me pick these books among the sea of others at the bookstore. 

I think that these covers utilize many of the design principles that were covered in the videos (which is probably why I noticed them!). Specifically, for *The History of Western Philosophy*: 

- **Balance and tension:** The front cover splits the title text and author text into the top and bottom of the page, divided by the horizon line of the background photo. This split isn't 50/50: it's more top-heavy (to accommodate the longer title); and the road doesn't go straight down the middle, but curves to the side. These two elements create a pleasing mix of balance and tension on the page. 
- **Scale:** The spine of this book actually defies the common design of book spines — to only include the author name and book title — which is why it stood out to me as so interesting! The name and title are relatively small, while the majority of the spine is taken up by an overview of the various philosophers that are covered in the book. I think that this design choice is especially fitting, given that this book consists of not so much *Russell's* ideas, but rather those of the many Western philosophers that came before him; then, it makes sense to "de-emphasize" his own name and instead allocate more space in the design to acknowledging those philosophers. 

For *The Republic*:

- **Negative space and contrast:** The front cover leaves negative space all around the sides of the cave in the background photo. This placement emphasizes the darkness of the cave in contrast to the light of the outside world, connecting the front cover to the Allegory of the Cave that Plato develops in the dialogue. 
- **Scale and hierarchy:** On the spine, the text of the author's name and the title are quite large, whereas the text describing the translation is relatively tiny (and rotated 90 degrees). The contrast between the large and small text is very pleasing to my eyes for some reason, and also creates a hierarchy so that the reader first notices the author, then the title, then the specific translation details of this version.   

I think that these principles will definitely help me make my designs more eye-catching and appealing; I will admit that I tend to play it safe and minimal with my designs, and tend to stick to ugly-but-functional sites like old.reddit.com and news.ycombinator.com, but these principles provide me with some good ideas and strategies to step out of my comfort zone. Recognizing that I only picked these books because of their covers also makes me more motivated to try new things and be more creative, because I would have glanced over them if they had stuck to convention and played it safe! And I wouldn't want someone to glance over my learning design!

# Video notes

During each section, there are 6 activities to complete: 
1. Watch the instructional videos
2. Post questions or comments about the videos in the discussion room 
3. Complete and submit the weekly assignment
4. Evaluate the work of peers using the instructor's rubric
5. Meet with the instructor and the rest of the class to receive feedback
6. Create a final mini-project at the end of class

## The Creative Process 

There are three phases of a creative graphic design process: 
1. Research 
2. Ideation
3. Production

A creative brief defines the project and identifies three main elements: goals, scope, and budget. Specifically, it can include: 
- target audience
- overall objectives
- potential lifespan of the project
- what's going to be produced 
- the message intended to be conveyed
- the call to action (CTA) 
- timeline for the different phases
- who needs to be involved, who's managing what
- budget

More on the creative process can be found in [[80-89 Arts & Culture/83 Design/83.01 Graphic Design/Aaris Sherin; Introduction to Graphic Design (2017)#Design process overview\|chapter 2 of Sherin]].

### Wireframes 

A wireframe is a 2D drawing of a page's interface. Wireframes allow you to think through your design process, ensure consistency throughout your design, and determine how the user will navigate through your interface. 

Wireframing process:
- Get inspired with examples 
- Create the building blocks of your wireframe. Ask:
		- What are the intended user and business goals when interacting with this page? 
		- How can you organize info in an intuitive way? 
		- What buttons does the user need in order to complete the desired actions? 
		- What does the user expect to see on certain parts of the page? 
- Fill in the details 
- Think about what info is the most important
- Generate your wireframe. You should be thinking about three things: 
	1. Clarity 
	2. User Confidence
	3. Simplicity
- Conduct usability tests
- Turn your wireframe into a clickable prototype


## Layout and Composition

A successful layout creates interest and attracts attention. Ask yourself anytime you see something interesting — why do I like this? 

### Layout elements

Shape
- Clarity and legibility is important
- The shapes can be implied
- Lines/rules can provide structure to the user 

Color
- Warm colors advance space, while cool colors recede 
- In different cultures, colors mean different things

Typography
- It will guide how the user sees and accesses the content

Negative space
- Negative space can command attention and increase interest
- If an element of the design isn't adding to the design, it's subtracting from it

Size
- Consider the context of where the design will be disseminated 

### Composition elements

Balance and tension
- Balance and tension should work in harmony to make the solution feel right 
- Black Square and Red Square by Kazmir Malevich:

	[![Black Square and Red Square by Kazimir Malevich|100](https://www.arthistoryproject.com/site/assets/files/20914/kazimir-malevich-black-square-and-red-square-1915-trivium-art-history.webp)
 
- Don't cut the page in half
- Don't put an element right in the center, or it will appear static
- Closer to the edge of the page creates tension

Contrast
- Extremes of color, size, etc.

Scale
- Size of the elements and their relation to each other
- Make sure that the elements aren't all the same size 

Repetition
- Duplicating the same image or form to enhance communication 
- But, "Consistency is the hog goblin of the mediocre"

Harmony
- Achieved when many disparate elements work together to achieve a pleasing effect 
- Echo shapes in the design (like curves)
- Similar proportions (like font sizes being a multiple of 4)
- Color from a unified palette

Hierarchy 
- Will guide the viewer through the design 
- Scale can establish a hierarchy (bigger text = first)
- Color too (like red)
