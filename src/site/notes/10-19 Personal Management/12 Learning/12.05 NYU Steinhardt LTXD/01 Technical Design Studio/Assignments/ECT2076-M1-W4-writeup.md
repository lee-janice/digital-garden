## Design description 

In this module, I attempted to a design a web-based data dashboard that would provide users with an interactive way to view the progress and impact of the CS4All initiative in NYC[^1]. In order to present the data in an intuitive way, I borrowed from the CAPE framework[^2] and used its four components — Capacity, Access, Participation, and Experience — as the organizational basis for my dashboard, as seen on the Home page. The design has come a long way since its initial conception, and I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to learn new skills and apply them throughout these past four weeks!

## Design choices

I made new design choices each week using the information that we learned and the feedback that we received, and integrated them into my final design. A summary of these choices is presented below.

### Design principles

The first week was crucial in setting the stage for the entirety of my design — it was through learning about design foundations and principles that I gained the motivation to step outside of my comfort zone and take big (or so it felt at the time) risks. The principles that I attempted to intentionally use in my wireframe were:

- shape, in the triangle / pyramid visual on the Home page,
- contrast, in the size of the text and colors on the page, and 
- balance / tension, in the size and positioning of the text. 

Contemplating these principles from the get-go allowed me to continuously refine their usage in the following iterations of my design.

### Proportions and grids 

I didn't change the layout significantly since my initial attempt at applying proportions and grids. Thus, my final design attempts to use the golden ratio and the rule of thirds, and each page had 36px and 44px margins, all of the pages (except for the menu page) used 26 columns, and all except for the home and menu page used 16 rows with a 10px gutter. The home page used 6 rows with a 40px gutter.

### Color and typography

I used the following color palette, from a Japanese book titled [*A Dictionary of Color Combinations*](https://sanzo-wada.dmbk.io/about):

The specific colors are as follows:
- Grenadine Pink #f48067
- Turquoise Green #b5decc
- Cream Yellow #fdbf68
- Calamine Blue #f8cdd0

For typography, I tried to use both a serif and a sans-serif typeface. The main typeface is Arial (as specified / required by the communications team at the Research Alliance for NYC Schools), and the accent typeface is Plantin Mt Pro.
