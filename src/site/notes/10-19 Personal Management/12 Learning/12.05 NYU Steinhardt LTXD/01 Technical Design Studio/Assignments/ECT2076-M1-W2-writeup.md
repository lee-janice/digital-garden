# Graphic Design 2 - Proportions and Grids

---

**Author:** Janice Lee

**Term:** Summer 2023

There were two main changes that I attempted to integrate into my design this week: (1) making the menu more menu-like, and (2) applying grids and proportions to my design. 

---
## The menu 

I'll first talk about the menu, since it will be a bit more brief: Xavier pointed out that it wasn't clear that the menu in my first iteration was supposed to be clickable, and I definitely agree! I tried to remedy this by making it a "drop-down-ish" menu, that would activate when the user clicks the red arrow / Research Alliance logo (I hope this is clear to the user!). However, instead of only dropping down into the current content screen, it would fill the entire screen with an overlay that allows the user to navigate to other pages. The user would close the menu by either selecting an item from the list, or clicking the red arrow / logo again.

## Grids and proportions

I will admit that modifying my design to fit a grid and proportion rules was a pretty challenging task for me! I'm not fully satisfied with the grid and proportion rules that I used, and I'll list at the end of my writeup (1) what went wrong, (2) a couple of reasons why I think that I struggled, and (3) strategies that I should try moving forward. 

### Grids 

I tried to define the margins, number of rows, number of columns, and gutters for each of my 4 pages in my learning design. I held the margins consistent across the design at 36px and 44px. All of the pages (except for the menu page) used 26 columns, and all except for the home and menu page used 16 rows with a 10px gutter. 

### Proportions

#### Golden Ratio

I tried to use the golden ratio to determine how large my triangle should be, since that was one thing that I was unsure about in my initial design. Unfortunately, the outline of the golden ratio didn't align with my margins, but I settled with just placing it between the vertical margins. Then, I used the corner of the squares to define the point at which to intersect my triangle. I'm not sure if that's a valid way to use the golden ratio, so I'd appreciate any feedback on my method! 

 I also tried to use it to define the sections where my logo and title would be contained â€” but I think I realize now that it isn't the best choice (it would be more clear and consistent to try to use the rule of thirds instead).

#### Rule of Thirds

I used the rule of thirds twice in my design. The first is on the menu page: I pushed the logo and menu options to the left third of the page, leaving the other two-thirds of the page blank. The second is on the About page, where (conveniently!) 3 sections of information are displayed. Each section takes up 8 columns, and there's one column of separation between each section.

## Reflection

### What went wrong

I'm not happy with a couple of things, including:

- Arbitrariness in how the margins, rows, columns, etc. are defined 
- Inconsistencies in how I align text within the gridlines (e.g., flush to the bottom of the line versus flush to the top versus in the middle of two lines)
- Title text is not always contained within the grid 

### Why I struggled 

There were a couple of reasons why I struggled. The first is that I think that I tried to "reverse-engineer" a grid to my design (e.g., plugging in numbers for rows and columns until it produced a pixel distribution that seemed to work), rather than planning a grid in advance and then placing my elements into the grid. 

The second is that I struggled with the layout of my design, especially with fitting the triangle in the home page into a rectangular grid. There was also a tension between simultaneously aligning the logo / title text and the page content within the same grid.

Finally, I think that I just am a novice with using grids and layouts for web design, and I need more practice!

### Strategies for the future

Some strategies that I think could help are: 

- Try to plan the out grid first without any of the design elements, then paste the elements in one-by-one
- Use a hierarchical grid structure instead of trying to apply the same grid to the whole page; separate the header and the content into two separate grid layouts 
- Look at more examples of how web designers use grids 

Hopefully I can implement these for next week's submission!
