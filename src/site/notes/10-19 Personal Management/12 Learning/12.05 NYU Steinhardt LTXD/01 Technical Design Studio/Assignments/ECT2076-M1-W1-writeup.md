# Design description

## Background

For my wireframe, I attempted to design a web-based data dashboard for my job at the Research Alliance for NYC Schools, where I evaluate the impact of the CS4All initiative (a 10-year, $81 million effort to bring computer science education to every NYC public school student). I've been trying to think of ways to disseminate our research to a wider audience and give back to / better inform those who are at the center of the work, and an interactive data dashboard seemed to fit the bill! 

I imagined that the data presented in the dashboard would be organized according to the four components of the CAPE framework[^1], illustrated below, which was developed to assess issues of equity in the CS education ecosystem.

Each component (Capacity, Access, Participation, Experience) would have its own dashboard page, and the data on the pages would answer the following questions: 

- **Capacity:** To what extent do schools and teachers have the resources to offer CS? 
- **Access:** How many schools and teachers are offering CS? 
- **Participation:** How many students are taking CS courses?
- **Experience:** What are the shorter- and longer-term outcomes of taking CS? 

These questions aren't same ones that the authors of the CAPE framework initially specified, but I think that the framework still works in a broader sense to assess the district's progress towards its goal of offering CS to "all" students! 

## Components

I drafted four components of my design:

- the Home page, 
- the Capacity data page, 
- the About page, and 
- the Executive Summary page. 

I chose to draft the About and Executive Summary pages in lieu of a quiz/assessment page, since I don't know if visitors to a data dashboard would appreciate being quizzed on our data...

# Design principles

The three design principles that I attempted to integrate into my wireframe were (1) shape, (2) contrast, and (3) balance and tension.

## Shape

My work here was already cut out for me! The authors of the CAPE framework had already packaged it nicely into a pyramid visualization, so I adapted this format for the Home page of my design. Using the triangular shape (hopefully) accomplishes the following:

- emphasizes the four categories of the CAPE framework in the triangle,
- provides organizational structure to the user by distinguishing each level of the framework from each other, and
- establishes a sense of hierarchy by guiding the user's eyes from the bottom to the top of the triangle.

In other components of the design, I tried to stick to triangular shapes (namely, to indicate either a drop-down menu or where there is additional content) and rectangular shapes (to delineate the spaces where the data will be displayed and where the narrative/summary content will go).

## Contrast 

I tried to step a bit out of my comfort zone here and create a LOT of contrast (by my standards) in my design, because I had the realization while writing up my discussion post for this past week that the use of contrast was one of the design principles that appealed to my eye the most! I tried to establish contrast in: 

- size, with the ginormous title text and teeny-tiny subtitle text, and 
- color, by using black text, a white background, and red emphasis to indicate where on the site the user is located (which was inspired by Ziyi's forum post on the MoMA website, thank you!). 

This contrast hopefully makes the visual logic of the site clear by directing the user's eyes to the relevant parts of the page in the correct order. 

## Balance and tension

Applying this principle definitely felt like the most risky part of the process, and at times I felt myself actively wishing to "fix" the tense parts of my design. But, I pushed through that feeling and tried to be okay with it because I wanted to experiment and go wild! I think the part with the most tension in my design is where the "EXPERIENCE" text on the home page pops out of the triangle â€” it creates an off-kilter look that I hope isn't too distracting. Also, I think the fact that the text isn't center-aligned in the triangle is another source of tension on the Home page. Hopefully, it's somewhat resolved by the balance of the text in the header and the symmetry and strong lines of the triangle itself! 

Another point of tension in my design is the top-heavy look of having the title and header area take up so much of the page, which is especially apparent when looking at the Executive Summary page. It's definitely something that I would never have tried if it weren't for the encouragement from the videos and design examples, so I'd appreciate any feedback as to whether it's too much or not!

# My first attempt 

As a way to document how differently I'm approaching design after being motivated and inspired by the videos and forum posts, here's the VERY first draft of the data dashboard that I made a couple of weeks ago:

What a difference!
