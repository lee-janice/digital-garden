| ECT        | EDCT-GE 2252  | Theories and Principles of Learning Analytics           | Advances in computing, internet, and sensing technologies are changing our relationship to data in all areas of life, including education and learning. Large quantities of detailed information is now routinely collected as part of our interaction with digital learning tools and social media, and tools for data collection in physical spaces are rapidly becoming more affordable and less intrusive. This creates exciting opportunities to generate insight that can help us better understand and improve learning, but it also raises questions about data rights, validity issues for different data-based inferences, and more broadly concerns about what the utilization of this data may mean for education and society. Importantly, the increasing prevalence and pervasiveness of data means that in the near future, critically assessing and making informed decisions about data use will be part of every education-related occupation. // Learning Analytics & Data Science in Education provides an introduction to uses of data in education that will help students develop their ability to evaluate data sources, perform analyses and critically evaluate applications of data use in real world educational situations. The course weaves together three strands of focus: a conceptual concern with selecting and interpreting data-based information, a technical emphasis on working with data and performing analyses, and a societal lens on understanding the opportunities, challenges and concerns that such data use presents. There are no prerequisites for this course and no previous experience in statistics, computer science or data manipulation is expected; however, students will be introduced to and asked to work with a selected set of data analysis tools and techniques during the course. | Xavier Ochoa        | 
| ECT        | EDCT-GE 2260  | Building Learning Analytics Applications                | In this course, students develop the technical and computational skills needed to create learning analytics applications that respond to real educational needs. The course explores the computational approaches needed to design and use algorithms to capture and automatically analyze data produced during online or face-to-face learning activities and to implement applications that provide feedback to the stakeholders of the learning process. As part of the course, students will independently create a prototype Learning Analytics application to address a real educational need. Prior coursework in EDCT-GE 2252: Learning Analytics and Data Science in Education or similar course is recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Xavier Ochoa        |

The second is for students to present their work in progress to be critiqued and reviewed by the class and instructor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | N/A                 | 
| ASH        | APSTA-GE 2014 | Statistical Analysis of Networks                        | This course is an introduction to the analysis and modeling of network data. Network analysis is a key tool in understanding relational data - data describing the relationships between pairs and groups of individuals, as well as the global structure of relationships. We will focus on applications to and building tools for research in the social sciences, but the methodology can be extended to other areas. By the end of the course, you should have a working knowledge of basic network analysis tools and be able to use them to analyze your own data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Yoav Bergner        |
