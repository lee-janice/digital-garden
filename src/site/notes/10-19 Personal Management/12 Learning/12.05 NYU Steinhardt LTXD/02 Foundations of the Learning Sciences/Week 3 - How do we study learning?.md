#  Kawulich, B. B. (2005). Participant observation as a data collection method. [26pp PDF]

## 1. Introduction

- ethnographic methods: observations, interviews, document analysis
	- Ethnography explores cultural phenomena from the point of view of the subject of the study.
	- Ethnography is also a type of [social research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_research "Social research") that involves examining the behavior of the participants in a given social situation and understanding the group members' own interpretation of such behavior.
- qualitative analysis/ethnographic methods are becoming increasingly common in education research 

## 2. Definitions

- ==observation==: the systematic description of events, behaviors, and artifacts in the social setting chosen for study (Marshall and Rossman, 1989)
- ==fieldwork==: active looking, improving memory, informal interviewing, writing detailed field notes, and perhaps most importantly, patience (DeWalt and DeWalt, 2002)
- ==participant observation==: the process enabling researchers to learn about the activities of the people under study in the natural setting through observing and participating in those activities (DeWalt and DeWalt, 2002); 
	- the process of learning through exposure to or involvement in the day-to-day or routine activities of participants in the researcher setting (Schensul, Shensul, LeCompte, 1999);
	- the process of establishing rapport within a community and learning to act in such a way as to blend into the community so that its members will act naturally, then removing oneself from the setting or community to immerse oneself in the data to understand what is going on and be able to write about it (Bernard, 1994)
- ==peopled ethnography==: text that provides an understanding of the setting and that describes theoretical implications through the use of vignettes, based on field notes from observations, interviews, and products of the group members (Fine, 2003)
- there is a tension between blending in sufficiently with the community so that you're observing authentic experiences, but not getting so involved that your personal opinions start to bias the research

## 3. The history of participant observation as a method

- one of the first instances of its use was the work of Frank Hamilton Cushing, who spent 4 1/2 years as a participant observer with the Zuni Pueblo people in 1879
	- Cushing learned the language, participated in the customs, was adopted by a pueblo, and was initiated into the priesthood
	- he was criticized as having lost his objectivity and his ability to write analytically about the culture 
- in 1888, Beatrice Potter Webb studied poor neighborhoods, taking a job as a rent collector to interact with the people in buildings and offices, and took a job as a seamstress in a sweatshop to better understand their lives
- in the early 1920s, Malinowski studied the Trobriands, and Margaret Mead studied the lives of adolescent Samoan girls 
- Stocking (1983) divided participant observation into three phases: participation, observation, and interrogation
	- he argued that Malinowski and Mead used observation and interrogation, but not participation; they held positions of power within the culture 
- more recently, sociologists have tried to take a more insider viewpoint by studying groups in their own cultures 

## 4. Why use observation to collect data? 

- participant observation allows researchers to:
	- develop a more holistic understanding of social phenomena: check for nonverbal expression of feelings, determine who interacts with whom, grasp how participants communicate with each other, check for how much time is spent on various activities, check definition of terms that participants use in interviews, observe events that informants may be unable or unwilling to share, observe situations informants have described in interviews
	- facilitate relationship with community members 
	- increase the study's validity: makes it possible to collect different types of data, lends credence to one's interpretation of the observations, sometimes the only way to collect the right data for one's study
- DeWalt and DeWalt (2002) believe that the goal of participant observation is to develop a holistic understanding of the phenomena under study that is as objective and accurate as possible given the limitations of the method
	- it can be used to help answer descriptive research questions, build theory, or generate/test hypotheses

## 5. Advantages and disadvantages of using participant observation

- advantages: 
	- grants access to the "backstage culture"
	- allows for richly detailed description
	- provides opportunities for viewing or participating in unscheduled events
	- improves quality of data collection and interpretation
	- facilitates the development of new research questions or hypotheses
- disadvantages:
	- sometimes the researcher may not be interested in what happens out of the public eye
	- different researchers gain different understanding of what they observe
	- information collected may not be representative of the culture
### 5.1 Limitations of observation
- researcher's identity can influence what information they are privy to: e.g., male and female researchers have access to different information 
	- the instrument for data collection is a biased human with various identities
- their identity can also affect whether or not they are accepted into the community 
- the researcher must determine to what extent they will participate in the lives of the participants, and whether to intervene in a situation
- researcher bias: likely to not report the negative aspects of the community 
	- Schensul, Schensul, and LeCompte (1999): the most accurate observations are shaped by formative theoretical frameworks and scrupulous attention to detail

## 6. The stances of the observer

- ==complete participant==: a member of the group being studied who conceals their researcher role from the group
	- disadvantages are that the researcher may lack objectivity, group members may feel distrustful of the researcher when the research role is revealed, and the ethics are questionable
- ==participant as observer==: the researcher is a member of the group being studied, and the group is aware of the research activity
	- disadvantages are that there is a tradeoff between depth of data revealed to the researcher and the level of confidentiality provided to the group 
- ==observer as participant==: main role of the researcher is to collect data, and the group being studied is aware of the researcher's observation activities; researcher is an observer who is not a member of the group 
	- the most ethical approach to observation
- ==complete observer==: researcher is completely hidden from view and the group being studied is unaware of the researcher's observation activities 

## 7. How does one know what to observe? 

- the researcher should: 
	- study what is happening and why 
	- determine regular from irregular activities 
	- look for variation to view the event from various viewpoints
	- look for negative cases or exceptions 
	- when behaviors exemplify the theoretical purposes for the observation, seek similar opportunities for observation and plan systematic observations of those events/behaviors 

## 8. How does one conduct an observation? 

- there is no one best way, but one effective way is to view informants as collaborators 
### 8.1 Ethics
- the researcher should inform the community members of their purpose for being there
- should also anonymize the observation to prevent identification 
- maintain relationships after research concludes
- can include community members in the research process 
- share findings with the community 
### 8.2 Gaining entry and establishing rapport
- the researcher should gain permission from the community to conduct the study 
	- bring letters of introduction, meet with community leaders, etc. 
	- develop relationships with key informants, who should be neutral to enable the researcher to meet informants of all factions found in the culture
- they should also become familiar with the setting and social organization of the culture
- they should gain trust and establish rapport with participants through "hanging out"
	- three stages: 
		- "stranger": researcher is learning the social rules and culture
		- "acquaintance": researcher is merging with the crowd
		- "intimate": researcher has established relationships and is comfortable with interactions with the community
### 8.3 The processes of conducting observations
- three types of processes:
	- ==descriptive observation==: one observes anything and everything, assuming that they know nothing
	- ==focused observation==: observation supported by interviews, in which the participants' insights guide what to observe 
	- ==selective observation==: the researcher focuses on different types of activities to delineate the differences in those activities
- observation guides, which include descriptions of: 
	- physical environment
	- participants 
	- activities and interactions that occur 
- ==prolonged engagement==: when the researcher spends a significant amount of time in the setting 
- ethnographer as an apprentice
- most anthropological research is conducted over a period of ~a year, but there have been observations conducted in a matter of weeks
- stages of participant observation:
	- culture shock; discovering the obvious; the break; focusing; exhaustion; the second break; frantic activity; leaving
- ==consensus analysis==: a method to design sampling frames for ethnographic research; involves understanding how participants think and verifying the information 

## 9. Tips for collecting useful observation data 

- be unobtrusive in dress and actions 
- become familiar with the setting before collecting data 
- keep observations short at first to avoid becoming overwhelmed
- be honest but not too technical/detailed in explaining to participants what you are doing
- shift from "wide" to "narrow" perspectives 
- look for key words in conversations to trigger later recollection of the conversation content
- concentrate on the first and last remarks of a conversation 
- during breaks in action, mentally replay remarks and scenes one has observed
- look at interactions including who talks to whom, how decisions are made, whose opinions are respected; where participants stand or sit
- count people or incidents of observed activity 
- keep a running observation record
- practice reciprocity 
- be tolerant of ambiguity
- have personal determination and faith in oneself to alleviate culture shock

## 10. Keeping and analyzing field notes and writing up the findings

- the researcher should map out the setting, which involves describing the relationship between the sociocultural behavior one observes and the physical environment
	- they should visit the site at multiple times of the day
	- they should describe without judgement (cultural relativism)
- mapping a setting involves:
	- a count of attendees, including demographics like age, gender, and race
	- a physical map of the setting and description of the physical surroundings
	- a portrayal of where participants are positioned over time
	- a description of the activities being observed, detailing activities of interest
- ==ritual==: the symbolic representation of the sentiments in a situation, involving person, place, time, conception, thing, or occasion; distinct from habits because habits don't have a symbolic meaning
- field notes are the primary way of capturing observation data, and include:
	- informal conversations with participants
	- records of activities and ceremonies
	- journal notes kept on a daily basis
- one suggestion is to use two notebooks: one with notes pertaining to the questions to be answered, one with other more personal observations 
	- the first would include jottings, maps, diagrams, interview notes, and observations
	- the second would include memos, casual mullings, questions, comments, diary type entries 
- good field notes:
	- use exact quotes when possible
	- use pseudonyms to protect confidentiality 
	- describe the activities in the order in which they occur
	- provide descriptions without inferring meaning
	- include relevant background information to situate the event
	- separate one's own thoughts and assumptions from what one actually observes
	- record the date, time, place, and name of researcher on each set of notes
- ==codes==: rules for organizing symbols into larger and more meaningful strings of symbols 
- when one is trying to analyze interview information and observation field notes, they are trying to develop a model that helps make sense of what the participants do 
	- one is constructing a model of culture, not telling *the* truth about the data 
- stages of model development:
	- first level: what happens
	- second level: what the ethnographer observes
	- third level: what was recorded
	- fourth level: what is derived from one's notes
	- fifth level: the theory that is developed from separate models of separate cultures

## 11. Teaching participant observation

- memory exercise: students are asked to think of a familiar place, like a room in their home, and make field notes of as much as they can remember; students then compare their notes to reality
- sight without sound: students are asked to find a setting in which they are able to see the activity but unable to hear what is being said, and record their observations
- sound without sight: students are asked to find a setting in which they are able to hear the activity but unable to see it, and record their observations
- photographic observation: students are asked to take a series of 12-36 photographs of an activity, and provide a written description of the activity that tells the story of what is happening, photo by photo
- direct observation: students are asked to record everything they can about a setting they wish to observe: on one side, their field notes from observation and on the other side, their thoughts, feelings, and ideas about what is happening
- participant observation: students are asked to participate in some activity that takes ~2 hours, in which they aren't able to take notes, then record their recollections as in much detail as they can remember as soon as the activity ends

# Tracy, S. (2010). Qualitative quality: Eight “big-tent” criteria for excellent qualitative research. [14pp PDF]

- This paper explores eight key markers of quality in qualitative research, including 
	- worthy topic
	- rich rigor
	- sincerity
	- credibility
	- resonance
	- significant contribution
	- ethics
	- meaningful coherence

## Introduction 

- key questions: 
	- "How can an inquirer persuade his or her audiences that the research findings of an inquiry are worth paying attention to?"
	- "Are these findings sufficiently authentic... that I (and research participants) may trust myself in acting on their implications? More to the point, would I feel sufficiently secure about these findings to construct social policy or legislation on them?"

## Why criteria and why this model?

- some qualitative scholars have opposed developing standards for qualitative research, suggesting that universal criteria are problematic, if not fruitless
- however, criteria are useful
	- rules and guidelines help us learn, practice, and perfect
	- they can encourage dialogue
- there are barriers to the development of criteria: people still equate scientific validity with numeric quantitative research emanating from a positivist paradigm
	- some qualitative scholars have responded by suggesting that criteria for goodness must be tied to specific theories, paradigms, or qualitative communities
	- however, many researchers start qualitative projects without knowing what theories will situate their research
- so, the author has tried to develop her own set of universal criteria for qualitative quality 
	- this paradigm discriminates between qualitative *ends* (goals for research) from *means* (ways by which the goals are achieved) 

## Eight criteria of quality in qualitative research

- (end goal)
	- (various means, practices, methods through which to achieve)
### Worthy topic
- the topic of the research is relevant, timely, significant, interesting, evocative 
- doesn't merely confirm existing assumptions
### Rich rigor
- the study uses sufficient, abundant, appropriate, and complex
	- theoretical constructs
	- data and time in the field 
	- sample(s)
	- context(s)
	- data collection and analysis processes
- richness is generated through a ==requisite variety== (the need for a tool or instrument to be at least as complex, flexible, and multifaceted as the phenomena being studied) of theoretical constructs, data sources, contexts, and samples 
- questions about rigor:
	- are there enough data to support significant claims?
	- did the researcher spend enough time to gather interesting and significant data? 
	- is the context or sample appropriate given the goals of the study? 
	- did the researcher use appropriate procedures in terms of field note style, interviewing practices, and analysis procedures? 
### Sincerity 
- the study is characterized by:
	- self-reflexivity about subjective values, biases, and inclinations of the researchers 
	- transparency about the methods and challenges
 - ==self-reflexivity==: honesty and authenticity with one's self, one's research, and one's audience
 - ==transparency==: honesty about the research process, a methodologically self-critical account of how the research was done 
### Credibility
- the research is marked by:
	- thick description, concrete detail, explication of tacit (nontextual) knowledge, and showing rather than telling
	- triangulation or crystallization
	- multivocality 
	- member reflections
- ==credibility==: the trustworthiness, verisimilitude, and plausibility of the research findings 
- ==thick description==: in-depth illustration that explicates culturally situated meanings and abundant concrete detail
- ==triangulation==: if two or more sources of data, theoretical frameworks, types of data collected, or researchers converge on the same conclusion, then the conclusion is more credible 
- ==crystallization==: the crystal as a "central imaginary" that transcended the "rigid, fixed, two-dimensional" triangle; encourages researchers to gather multiple types of data and employ various methods, multiple researchers, and numerous theoretical frameworks
- ==multivocality==: includes multiple and varied voices in the qualitative report and analysis
- ==member reflections==: methods of taking findings back to the field and determining whether the participants recognize them as true or accurate 
### Resonance
- the research influences, affects, or moves particular readers or a variety of audiences through
	- aesthetic, evocative representation
	- naturalistic generalizations
	- transferable findings
- ==resonance==: the research's ability to meaningfully reverberate and affect an audience 
- ==aesthetic merit==: the text is presented in a beautiful, evocative, and artistic way 
- ==transferability==: a study's potential to be valuable across a variety of contexts or situations, achieved when readers feel as though the story of the research overlaps with their own situation and they intuitively transfer the research to their own action 
- ==naturalistic generalization==: improved practice through the feeling of personal knowing and experience 
### Significant contribution
- the research provides a significant contribution 
	- conceptually/theoretically
	- practically
	- morally
	- methodologically
	- heuristically
 - ==theoretically significant== research is intellecually implicative for the scholarly community
 - ==heuristic significance== moves people to further explore, research, or act on the research in the future
 - ==practically significant== research asks whether the knowledge is useful 
 - ==methodological significance==: whether the research introduces a new methodological approach
### Ethical
- the research considers
	- procedural ethics 
	- situational and culturally specific ethics 
	- relational ethics
	- exiting ethics
- ==procedural ethics==: ethical actions dictated as universally necessary by larger organizations, institutions, or governing bodies 
- ==situational ethics==: ethical practices that emerge from a reasoned consideration of a context's specific circumstances 
- ==relational ethics==: mutual respect, dignity, and connectedness between the researcher and the researched
- ==exiting ethics==: how a researcher leaves a setting and shares the results
### Meaningful coherence 
- the study
	- achieves what it purports to be about 
	- uses methods and procedures that fit its stated goals
	- meaningfully interconnects literature, research questions/foci, findings, and interpretations with each other
