# Class summary

Welcome! This week is our first foray together into the learning sciences (foray = an initial and often tentative attempt to do something in a new field). The learning sciences brings together a study of human cognition with larger ideas about the roles of culture and context to provide a holistic account (or accounts) of how learning occurs in real world situations (these can be both in- and out-of-school). But learning scientists aren't content to just understand how learning occurs, they also want to make it happen better - thus there is an emphasis on the role of design (of innovative learning environments) as a way to improve learning and our knowledge about how it happens.

This week we'll spend time getting oriented to the course and how we'll be learning together this semester. Your core reading is a nice summary (from a few years ago) by Bransford et al. of the many things we know about how learning happens and how we can best promote it. There are also two optional readings by Lee and Sawyer which give more context about where the field of "Learning Sciences" came from and the kinds of things we are interested in studying further with a special emphasis on the role of technology and design. As you read, note the use of the term "science" (or sciences) and the ways what they discuss are similar and different to ways you've thought about learning in the past. Finally, you will take a look at a recent piece of LS research that we will use throughout the semester as an example. You do not need to give it a careful reading, nor even read the whole of it yet, just take a look at the abstract, intro and conclusions to start familiarizing yourself with it. We'll come back to it multiple times to see how they animate the different concepts we encounter over the course of the semester.

# Reflection 

- What is my first impression after this reading? (e.g. difficult, easy to understand, useful, draining)
- What are questions you have because of what you just read?
- What are you confused about of what the author was trying to say?
- How are parts of the content of the reading similar or different to other learning lenses?
- What parts of the reading are you taking with you after reading?
- What parts of the reading are you leaving behind after reading?

- The readings were all pretty digestible to me! I especially felt that the Sawyer (2022) reading provided an in-depth overview of various important perspectives and trends in the field of the Learning Sciences, and the Nasir et al. (2021) reading discussed a framework for integrating existing theories of learning into one holistic view and postulated some future directions for the field.
- Things that surprised me:
	- How nascent of a field the Learning Sciences is 
	- How it was initially associated with AI
- Key takeaways:
	- There appear to be a lot of tensions / tradeoffs in education 
		- providing students with authentic experiences vs. experiences that match their expertise
		- engaging students in deep learning vs. assessing student knowledge
- Questions: 
	- A lot of questions regarding situating LS in relation to other fields (which is how I feel like a lot of my mental modeling functions): 
		- Relationship between LS and AI? (Is the relationship bidirectional?)
		- What is ISD, and is it still in use today? What is the current relationship between LS and ISD? 
		- What is the relationship between LS and cogsci? 
		- What is the relationship between LS and Learning and Instructional Design Technology (LIDT)?
	- How does one go about "assessing" deep learning? 
	- Critical quantitative/computational methods? 
	- Seminal works in LS? Will we read them in this class? 
- Thoughts for the future: 
	- It seems that the field is somewhat "teleological" in that it relies heavily on assumptions or philosophies of what "good/successful" learning looks like and describes or develops mechanisms to bring about that sort of learning -- I guess I'm just wondering if I should solidify what I believe the "aims of education" should be (or whether we'll cover that in this course) and what "good" or "desirable" learning looks like
	- Would love to make a mind map/diagram of how theories of learning and pedagogies relate to each other; also how learning sciences relates to other disciplines

# Sawyer (2022) Introduction to the Learning Sciences 

## Introduction

- The learning sciences is the interdisciplinary study of teaching and learning. 
- It began as a discipline in 1991 with the first *Journal of the Learning Sciences* volume was published. 
- **Instructionism**: the early 20th century approach to education that emphasizes the passive transmission of facts and procedures from the teacher to the student; criticized by Paulo Freire as the "banking" concept of education
- By the 1990s, learning scientists reached a consensus on ==a few basic facts of learning: ==
	- The importance of deeper conceptual understanding
	- The importance of connected learning, where each piece of knowledge is linked to many others
	- Focusing on learning in addition to teaching, where students are active participants
	- Designing learning environments 
	- The importance of groups and contexts
	- The importance of building on a learner's prior knowledge
	- The importance of reflection
- **Problem-posing education**: a model of inquiry-based learning that is active, participatory, and constructivist
- Findings from learning sciences research are often widely applicable to diverse contexts, cultures, and student demographics

## The goals of education and the nature of knowledge

- **Logical empiricism**: the early 20th century view that knowledge consists of statements about the world and logical operations applied to those statements; related to behaviorism and instructionism
- The new epistemology, beginning in the 1960s, views scientific knowledge as an understanding of how to go about doing science, combined with deep knowledge of models and explanatory principles connected into an integrated conceptual framework
- Cutting-edge work in the sciences is increasingly done at the boundaries of disciplines, meaning that students need to learn deep and connected interdisciplinary knowledge
- ==Important findings of LS==
	- Students gain deeper understanding when they engage in authentic practices: activities that are similar to the activities of professionals who work in a discipline
	- Learning most often takes place in complex social settings and with a variety of tools; situativity: the view that knowledge is a dynamic, contextual process involving the learner and their interactions with the social, cultural, and material environment
	- There is a tension between providing students with experiences that match their current expertise and engaging them in authentic practices
		- Reminds me of [The Novice as Expert: Writing the Freshman Year](https://www.rit.edu/writing/sites/rit.edu.writing/files/documents/The%20Novice%20as%20Expert.pdf)

## Processes involved in learning 

- learning sciences research can be elemental (studying separate components of the learning environment) or systemic (viewing the environment holistically/as a system)
- ==common LS research topics==
	- how learning happens: ==the transition from novice to expert performance==
	- how learning happens: ==using prior knowledge==
	- promoting better learning: ==scaffolding==
	- promoting better learning: ==externalization and articulation==
		- Vygotsky's theory of mental development: all knowledge begins as visible social interaction and is gradually internalized by the learner to form new thoughts and concepts
	- promoting better learning: ==reflection==
		- metacognition: thinking about learning while learning; reflecting on learning
	- promoting better learning: ==building from concrete to abstract knowledge==
		- Piaget's theory of learning: Learning begins with concrete information and gradually becomes more abstract
		- visual and spatial understanding often precede and can be used to develop verbal understanding

## Sociocultural studies 

- learning happens in complex social and cultural (and often non-formal) environments, meaning that it should be studied in groups and cultural contexts, not just at the individual level
- four strands of sociocultural research:
	- socialization: how children learn the norms and conventions of their culture
	- informal apprenticeship learning in non-Western societies
	- socially distributed nature of knowledge work 
	- learning in museums and science centers
- **situated social practices**: visible patterns of interaction with other people, cultural practices, and material tools in one's environment

## Social justice and the learning sciences

- due to its grounding in a sociocultural framework, LS is uniquely positioned to study how learning interacts with power, equity, and social justice, and to develop pedagogies for equitable learning

## Educational technology

- LS research increasingly involves computer technology and suggests that computers should take on more of a facilitating role than an information delivery/assessment role in learning 
- computer technology can support deep learning due to its visual and processing power:
	- computers can represent abstract knowledge in concrete form 
	- computer tools can allow learners to articulate and reflect on their knowledge in a visual and verbal way
	- computers can allow learners to manipulate their developing knowledge
	- internet-based networks of learners can share and benefit from collaborative learning 

## Methodologies

- methodologies in education research:
	- experimental/quasi-experimental design
	- design-based research 
	- interaction analysis: a methodology that studies interactions between learners, their learning practices, and individual learning

## The emergence of the field of learning sciences 

- in the 1980s, research centers, institutes, and universities were drawing on cog sci and AI to design software for learning (e.g., Institute for Research on Learning, Vanderbilt's Center for Learning and Technology, Seymour Papert's Logo group, Schank's Institute for Learning Sciences)
- came together to start the Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) conferences that are still held today 
- in 1991, the first issue of the *Journal of the Learning Sciences* was published, and Roy Pea created the first LS doctoral program at Northwestern University
- in 2002, the International Society of the Learning Sciences was founded

# Kolodner (2004) The learning sciences: Past, present and future

- in this paper: what is the difference between instructional systems design (ISD) and the learning sciences? 
	- instructional systems design: the systemic approach to the design, implementation, and evaluation of learning solutions

## A history of the learning sciences

- in the 1980s, cognitive scientists began to become frustrated with the field of cognitive science, feeling that the complexity of the real world was not being accounted for by current research (e.g., focusing on toy problems with narrow contexts, ignoring social and physical worlds)
- at the same time, researchers in ed psych, cog sci, and AI were frustrated by the narrow focus of the AI in Education community, wanting to do more than build intelligent tutors 
	- Seymour Papert: Logo
	- Andy diSessa: Boxer 
	- Alan Kay: DynaBook
	- Rick Duschl, Bob Glaser, Barbara White, and Alan Lesgold: designing software for simulating real-world environments 
	- Roy Pea, Jan Hawkins, and Rich Lehrer: uses of hypertext, word processing, and other general-purpose software programs in support of learning
	- Ann Brown, Joe Campione, John Bransford, Susan Goldman, Jim Pellegrino, and Allan Collins: how to promote deep and lasting learning
	- Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter: software to help people learn to be writers 
- people began formalizing separate spaces for this work:
	- Roger Schank's Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern
	- Xerox's Institute for Research on Learning
	- Vanderbilt's Center for Learning and Technology 
- the *Journal of the Learning Sciences* published its first issue in 1991
	- it was a venue to publish "big ideas" about learning and promoting learning, devoted to learning in real-world situations
- the AI and Education conference initially joined the first International Conference of the Learning Sciences at Northwestern in 1991, but separated the following year 
- the International Conference of the Learning Sciences is every two years and the Computer Support for Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is in the years in between 
- the majority of the papers were about 
	- methodology
	- classroom studies
	- careful descriptions of learning
	- software design
	- integration
	- evaluation
	- curriculum design,
	- with a central focus on complexity and systemic approaches to curriculum design, understanding classrooms, teacher education, and reform
- the community has matured over time by understanding that the description of learning is not enough -- rather, engineering, predicting, and observing situations is necessary; also, more complex situations are often reported on

## The learning sciences as a community of practice

- Learning scientists use and develop theories of active, constructivist, and participatory learning to design software, pedagogies, and environments that promote deep learning
- ==Learning sciences== is the interdisciplinary pursuit of 
	- studying deep, applicable learning and the environments in which learning occurs; 
	- designing software, pedagogies, and other materials to promote deep learning; and 
	- developing methodologies to study learning. 
- ==Learning scientists believe that== 
	- learners are social animals who learn through participation and the active construction of mental models 
	- technology (when designed correctly) can promote deep learning
	- the work should be done with those who know learning environments and learners well
	- learning should be studied in real-world environments
	- design is an important kind of research in and of itself

# Nasir et al. (2021) Rethinking Learning: what interdisciplinary science tells us

## Introduction

- ==four key principles of learning (RISE principles): ==
	- learning is **Rooted** in evolutionary, biological, and neurological systems
	- learning is **Integrated** with other developmental processes; the whole child must be taken into account
	- learning is **Shaped** in culturally organized practice across people's lives 
	- learning is **Experienced** as embodied and coordinated through social interaction
- education and schooling is deeply political in nature

## Learning theory and the design of instruction

- ==**behaviorism**==: the idea popularized in the 1940s/50s that learning is the result of associations between stimuli (reinforcement or punishment, + their timing) and responses or consequences; key people are Thorndike and B.F. Skinner
	- informs instructionism 
- ==**cognitivism**==: the view developed in the 1960s/70s that learning is an active process of constructing, storing, and manipulating symbolic representations of information
	- informs project-based learning
- ==**sociocultural theory**==: the 1990s-present view that learning is participatory and rooted in identity
	- informs CR-SE (?)
- each framework contributes partial truths; we need a theory of learning that integrates these insights
- this paper contributes two insights
	- learning is fundamentally cultural, not only as an additive layer, but at each level (biological, neurological, social, ideological)
	- viewing learning this way contributes to better science and to understanding/addressing educational inequality
- in the context of an inequitable society, learning theories should support the needs of diverse groups of students and celebrate diverse ways of being, knowing, and doing

## Building blocks of a contemporary theory of learning

### Learning is rooted in evolutionary, biological, and neurological systems

- there is a growing consensus that evolution is both biological and cultural 

> [!note]
> this seems related to [[epigenetics\|epigenetics]] and [[dual inheritance theory\|dual inheritance theory]]

- human brains are malleable and social (wired to learn from implicit and observational stimuli); brain development and cultural experience influence each other
- learning is enhanced or impeded by emotion 
- the education of students with learning disabilities is another intersection between biological/cultural systems
- => learning is a pervasive and fundamentally human activity that arises out of our biological need to be connected to social others and to adapt to the environment 

### Learning is integrated with other developmental processes whereby the whole child must be considered

- learning is integrated with developmental domains such as cognitive, social, emotional, identity, and cultural processes
- membership in marginalized groups means that one must manage environments that are not set up to meet one's developmental needs and thus are designed to reinforce marginalization 
- identity and learning are deeply intertwined 
- emotional needs for safety and belonging are key components of the learning process

### Learning is shaped in culturally organized practice across people's lives

- learning often happens in non-formal, community-oriented spaces 
- learning happens on multiple pathways at once
- learning at its best is a tapestry where what is learned in one setting is built upon in another 
- learning settings are often power-laden, historically located, and weighted with histories of oppression and/or freedom
- what we learn and how we learn it are also non-neutral

### Learning is experienced as embodied and coordinated through social interaction 

- uses of the body (language, gestures, eye gaze, etc.) are key to how learning operates 
- it also can serve to position learners into identities in learning spaces 
- when diverse discourse practices are honored, opportunities for robust learning arise

## A research agenda for the future of learning

- new methodological and theoretical tools are necessary; qualitative (social design-based experiments) and quantitative (critical quant/computational methods), intersectional analyses
- scholars should interrogate long-standing methodological debates (nature v. nurture, quantitative v. qualitative)
- another new area is understanding consequences for learning of new kinds of institutions and partnerships designed to improve learning (e.g., research-practice partnerships)
- another is more sophisticated measures of deep learning
- another is deeper inclusion of families, communities, and youth in these partnerships

## Implications for equitable teaching and learning 

- instruction should invite diversity in pathways of participation and take into account a multiplicities knowledges and educational practices
- assessment practices must also be expanded to account for the richness of multiple pathways of learning and knowing 
	- requires an expanded set of curricular resources, and for teachers to have deeper knowledge of their disciplines
- learning cannot happen without consideration of the developmental, emotional, and psychosocial needs of learners
	- systems of oppression are not separate from processes of learning within these systems
- teacher professional development should attend to the cultural foundations of learning and development
