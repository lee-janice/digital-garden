# Introduction 

This week we dive head first into the course material, starting with the core idea of theory as a lens for seeing the world. We start with two ways of conducting learning research based in very different world views - Bryman shows how "quantitative" research is based on an _objectivist lens_ (which believes there is a single best explanation of social phenomena like learning) while "qualitative" research is based on an _constructionist lens_ (which sees the meaning of social phenomena as multifaceted and changing). I like to think about these two world views personified as a "miner" (trying to extract golden nuggets of knowledge truth) and a "traveler" (who gains perspective on different cultures through interacting with them) as a way to encapsulate each world view - the first video explains this idea in more depth.

In addition to lenses for research, different theories in the learning sciences can also be thought of as lenses for seeing the world (just like glasses they bring some elements into focus over others). The Crook & Sutherland (2017) reading gives a nice overview of many of the theories we'll be studying this semester and how they fit together as part of a larger whole. You can get a sense of the different aspects of learning different theories focus on by looking at the topic titles for weeks 4 through 10 on the main schedule page and in this week's second video.

Finally, we'll explore exactly what the "learning in the wild" project is all about and you'll get started in figuring out your site and project team.

# Bryman, A. (2012). Social research strategies. [23pp PDF]

This chapter explores:
- the relationship between theory and research (deductive vs. inductive approach)
- epistemological issues
- ontological issues 
- research strategy: quantitative vs. qualitative 
- the way values and practical issues impinge on the social research process

## Introduction 

- Methods of social research are closely tied to different visions of how social reality should be studied; methods are not neutral tools 
- There is the question of how research methods and practice connect with the wider social scientific enterprise; data is usually collected in relation to something (social problem, theory)

## Theory and research 

Two important questions:
- What type of theory is one talking about? 
- Are data collected to test or to build theories? 
### What type of theory? 
- Examples of sociological theory include symbolic interactionism (the view of social behavior that emphasizes shared modes of communication like language and its subjective understanding), structural-functionalism, critical theory, poststructuralism, etc. 
- [grand theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_theory): in sociology, an approach to theories where the formalism and structure of concepts takes priority over applications to social reality (e.g., [structural functionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_functionalism))
- [middle-range theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-range_theory_(sociology)): in sociology, an approach to theorizing where theories about social reality can be verified/are generalized from empirical data; typically apply to a specific domain rather than to society at large
- In some cases, the literature (prior studies/publications/findings in the research area) can be used in lieu an explicit theory
- empiricism: (1) the view that only knowledge gained through experience and observation is valid; (2) the view that the discovery of "facts" about the world is a legitimate goal 
### Deductive and inductive theory
- deductive theory: the approach where hypotheses are formed from what is known about the domain (general to specific); theory guides empirical data collection
	- induction occurs when researchers use findings to make modifications to the original theory 
- inductive theory: the approach where theories are developed from generalizations of observations (specific to general); data collection guides theory-crafting 
	- deduction occurs when researchers perform an iterative process assess the validity of the theory based on data and collect additional data as needed
 
## Epistemological considerations

- epistemological practices can influence/inform research practices
### A natural science epistemology: positivism 
- positivism: an epistemological position that advocates for the application of methodologies of natural sciences to the social sciences; holds that 
	- (1) only experience and observation can be warranted as knowledge (phenomenalism)
	- (2) the purpose of theory is to generate hypotheses that can be tested (deductivism)
	- (3) knowledge is gained by gathering facts that provide the basis for laws (inductivism)
	- (4) science must be conducted in a value-free way (objective) 
	- (5) there is a clear distinction between scientific and normative statements
- realism: the belief that the natural and social sciences can and should apply the same approaches to data and explanation; and that there exists an external reality that is separate from our descriptions of it 
		- empirical realism: holds that through the use of appropriate methods, reality can be understood
		- critical realism: holds that we will only be able to understand and change the social world if we identify the structures at work that generate it 
### Interpretivism 
- interpretivism: an anti-postivist epistemological position that holds that the social sciences are fundamentally different from the natural sciences and requires a different approach; emphasizes understanding (and thus interpreting) subjective human action rather than explaining it objectively
	- hermeneutics: the interpretation and understanding of social events through the analysis of their meanings for the individuals in the events 
	- phenomenology: the study of how individuals perceive and operate in the world; the study of the objective world as subjectively lived and experienced (i.e., attempting to see things from the subject's point of view)
	- symbolic interactionism: the view of social behavior that emphasizes shared communication and its subjective understanding 
	- An interpretive stance to social science research requires three levels of interpretation: (1) how the subjects interpret the world around them, (2) how the researcher interprets their perceptions/observations, and (3) how the researcher interprets these interpretations in the context of the existing research in the domain

## Ontological considerations 

- social ontology: the nature of social entities 
	- Should social entities be considered as having a reality external to social actors (objectivism), or as social constructions built up from the perceptions and actions of social actors (constructionism)? 
### Objectivism
- objectivism: an ontological position that holds that social phenomena have an external reality separate from social actors 
### Constructionism
- constructionism: an ontological position that holds that societal and cultural concepts (including researchers' theories of the social world) are continually being created by individuals; the absence of a determinate social reality 
### Relationship to social research
- Ontological assumptions and commitments influence how research questions are formulated and how research is carried out 

## Research strategy: quantitative and qualitative research

- quantitative research: a research strategy that emphasizes quantification in the collection and analysis of data; 
	- theory in relation to research: deductive, testing of theory
	- epistemological orientation: natural science model (positivism)
	- ontological orientation: objectivism
- qualitative data: emphasizes words rather than quantification 
	- theory in relation to research: inductive, generation of theory
	- epistemological orientation: interpretivism
	- ontological orientation: constructionism
- mixed-methods research: research that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches

## Influences on the conduct of social research

### Values 
- The values (personal beliefs and feelings) of a researcher affects how they conduct research 
- It may be not be feasible for a researcher to suppress all of their values 
- reflexivity: when a researcher is self-reflective of their values and biases and how they might influence their research 
### Practical considerations
- Choice of research strategy, design, or method has to take into consideration:
	- the research questions
	- the nature of the topic and people being investigated
	- etc.

## Introduction

- Four approaches to/frameworks of learning: behaviorist, cognitivist, constructivist, social constructivist

## From behaviorism to information processing

- Behaviorism produced the vision of "machines-that-teach" based on the principles of operant conditioning in the form of "programmed instruction", which would present a logical sequence of tasks to the learners, who were given immediate and tailored feedback
- The emergence of digital technology inspired an alternative to behaviorism
	- Cognitive science emerged as a response to the engineering successes of information theory - the learner became an "information processing system"
	- Richard Mayer's (2001) cognitive theory of learning
		- (1) humans possess separate channels for processing auditory and visual information
		- (2) there is a limit to how much information can be processed within a channel
		- (3) humans engage in active learning by organizing incoming information into coherent mental representations 
	- but this still placed students within passive encounters in educational practices

## The rise of constructivism 

- Constructivism insists that knowledge is not "acquired" but discovered by the learner through exploration and constructing their own concepts 
	- technology shifted from being the learner's "tutor" to the learner's "tutee"; conceptualization of technology as an arena for exploration 
	- "schema" theories of knowledge began to emerge 
	- the learner became more active, but the world remained static — a dynamic world would include engagement with other people
- Social constructivism addressed this gap

## A turn to the social and cultural 

- sociocultural theory holds that learning is the appropriation and mastering of symbolic and technical cultural tools within social practices
- has been embraced by many researchers interested in technology-enhanced learning 
- related to:
	- situated cognition
	- situated action
	- cultural psychology
	- distributed cognition
	- activity theory
- (Saljo 2010) digital technologies not only support learning but also transform how we learn and how we interpret learning
	- institutional traditions of schooling are inextricably linked to the printed text
	- developments of multimedia digital texts are changing literary practices from a focus on interpretation to a focus on "reading as design"
	- calls for the "performative turn in the interpretation of learning"

## Which theory? Reconciling differences

- There are four major frameworks for learning: behaviorist, cognitivist, constructivist, and social-cultural. 
- These frameworks are not necessarily in conflict with each other -- one way to reconcile them is with explanatory "layers" of learning, from the micro to the macro level.
- connectionism: an approach to studying cognition that uses models of connections between computational units (like neurons) to explain learning
	- technology related to connectionist thinking: instructional systems that are adaptive to learners' activity, learning environments that reflect the implicit structures of how connectionist systems learn 

## Some emerging diversity of theoretical frameworks 

### Cognitive theoretical themes
- cognitive load theory: the view that the capacity of working memory is limited and too much cognitive load impacts one's ability to learn; implies that the design of educational materials should reduce the learner's cognitive load
- dual coding theory: the view that language and mental imagery are distinct forms of knowledge used by the mind; carries implications for how multi-modal material is most efficiently presented for learning 
### Social constructivist themes
- conversation theory: the view that learning occurs through communication and interactions between individuals
- contingent teaching: the approach where teachers adjust their instruction to their students' diverse needs and levels of understanding
- communities of practice: the view that learning occurs through participation in groups with shared goals 
### Acknowledging individual differences
- multiple intelligences
- learning style 

## From learning to knowledge building

- (Bereiter 1997) knowledge-building conception of mind
	- draws on Popper (1972) to differentiate between objects in:
		- World 1: the physical world
		- World 2: conceptual objects of the mind
		- World 3: the world of knowledge objects
	- claims that "Learning is activity directed towards World 2. It is doing something to alter the state of your mind to achieve a gain in personal knowledge or competence"
	- contrastingly, knowledge-building is activity directed towards World 3
	- suggests that learning theories need to focus on World 3 knowledge objects as well as World 2 conceptual objects of the mind; and focus of school education should shift from improving students' minds to improving their theoretical knowledge
	- developed the "Knowledge Forum", a multimedia database for collective knowledge building (like wikis)
- (Young 2013) "powerful knowledge": socially constructed theoretical knowledge vs. "knowledge of the powerful"
