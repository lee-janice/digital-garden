# Annotating in Perusall 

Read / watch each of the readings or videos, annotating with your thoughts related to each of the following four questions.
1. **Key Ideas:** _What are the key ideas of this learning sciences lens / approach?_ Tag with #keyidea and the #topic (e.g. #CV for constructivism) and say what the key idea is and why it matters
2. **New Terms:** _What are key new terms worth remembering and what do they mean?_ Tag with #vocab and include the best explanation of its meaning you can (remember that specific uses of words in the learning sciences may differ from dictionary definitions!)
3. **Connections:** _How is this lens / approach similar with or different from others we study?_ Tag with the two topics and explain what you see as #similar or #different about them (e.g #CV #CN are #similar b/c building knowledge in both)
4. **Questions:** _What is confusing or raises questions for you?_ Just include a “?” in your comment

# **Preparations for each week's discussion**

We will be discussing the readings each week in class, and to prepare for that discussion, I'm asking everyone to prepare the answers to the following questions: 

- What is my first impression after this reading? (e.g. difficult, easy to understand, useful, draining)
- What are questions you have because of what you just read?
- What are you confused about of what the author was trying to say?
- How are parts of the content of the reading similar or different to other learning lenses?
- What parts of the reading are you taking with you after reading?
- What parts of the reading are you leaving behind after reading?

Be prepared to **very briefly** share your answers to these questions **each class.**
