# Graphic Design 3 - Typography and Color

## Typography

I used two typefaces in my design: Arial and Plantin MT Pro. Overall, I didn't make a ton of changes to the typography of my design, for two reasons:

- First, and most importantly, the communications team at the Research Alliance has already established the typefaces that they want to use for all of our public-facing materials, and that typeface is Arial. 
- Secondly, when I experimented with adding a second typeface to my design, I felt that it was a bit distracting, since there's already a lot going on in the page — so, I thought that sticking primarily to one typeface (but using the different fonts within it) would provide the best readability for the user. 

Now onto the changes that I did make: 

- Admittedly, Arial is not my *favorite* set of fonts to work with, but I tried to spruce it up by adjusting the kerning for the header text. I think that having the letters closer together emphasizes the text and makes it appear stronger in the design. 
- I did experiment with adding a second typeface (Plantin MT Pro) to my design, which I used primarily as an interactive emphasis in the home and menu screens — I imagined that when the user hovers their cursor over certain text, the font would change to indicate that the user can click on the text to navigate to another page. I picked a serif font so that it would provide enough contrast for the user to notice a change. 

Hopefully these changes are not too distracting!

## Color

In my original design, I didn't feel as though I had places where I could experiment with and change the colors, so I added a few more elements, namely the transparent text in the header, the footer text, the menu icon, and the underline for text. Adding these elements allowed me to define and integrate a different color for each page in my design. 

I picked the color palette for my design using a cute little book called [*A Dictionary of Color Combinations*](https://sanzo-wada.dmbk.io/about) — I hope that this isn't cheating!

I chose this particular palette because I wanted to use colors that convey more modern/digital sensibilities (light, vivid, and almost-fluorescent colors), rather than more traditional ones, like the palette below may suggest:

I hope that the addition of the new elements on the page isn't taking away from the clarity of the design — I'd appreciate any feedback on whether it is or not!
