# Graphic Design Module - Final Draft

## Design description 

In this module, I attempted to a design a web-based data dashboard my job at the Research Alliance for NYC Schools, where I evaluate the impact of the CS4All initiative (a 10-year, $81 million effort to bring computer science education to every NYC public school student). I hoped that this dashboard would provide users with an interactive platform to view the progress of the CS4All initiative in NYC. In order to present the data in an intuitive way, I borrowed from the CAPE framework[^1] and used its four components — Capacity, Access, Participation, and Experience — as the organizational basis for my dashboard, as seen on the Home page.

Each component (Capacity, Access, Participation, Experience) would have its own dashboard page, and the data on the pages would answer the following questions: 

- **Capacity:** To what extent do schools and teachers have the resources to offer CS? 
- **Access:** How many schools and teachers are offering CS? 
- **Participation:** How many students are taking CS courses?
- **Experience:** What are the shorter- and longer-term outcomes of taking CS? 

The design has come a long way since its initial conception, and I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to learn new skills and apply them throughout these past four weeks!

## Design choices

I made new design choices each week using the information that we learned and the feedback that we received, and integrated them into my final design. A summary of these choices is presented below.

### Design principles

The first week was crucial in setting the stage for the entirety of my design — it was through learning about design foundations and principles that I gained the motivation to step outside of my comfort zone and take big (or so it felt at the time) risks. The principles that I attempted to intentionally use in my wireframe were:

- shape, in the triangle / pyramid visual on the Home page,
- contrast, in the size of the text and colors on the page, and 
- balance / tension, in the size and positioning of the text. 

Contemplating these principles from the get-go allowed me to (1) step outside of my comfort zone and try a design that I viewed as "risky", and (2) continuously refine their usage in the following iterations of my design.

### Proportions and grids 

I haven't changed the layout significantly since my initial attempt at applying proportions and grids. Thus, my final design attempts to integrate the golden ratio and the rule of thirds, and each page has 36px and 44px margins, all of the pages (except for the menu page) uses 26 columns, and all except for the home and menu page uses 16 rows with a 10px gutter. The home page uses 6 rows with a 40px gutter.

### Color and typography

I used the following color palette, from a Japanese book titled [*A Dictionary of Color Combinations*](https://sanzo-wada.dmbk.io/about):

The specific colors are as follows:
- Grenadine Pink #f48067
- Turquoise Green #b5decc
- Cream Yellow #fdbf68
- Calamine Blue #f8cdd0

I chose this particular palette because I wanted to use colors that convey more modern/digital sensibilities (light, vivid, and almost-fluorescent colors), rather than more traditional tones.

For typography, I tried to use both a serif and a sans-serif typeface. The main typeface is Arial (as specified / required by the communications team at the Research Alliance for NYC Schools), and the accent typeface is Plantin Mt Pro. In order to spruce up the Arial text (because it's not my favorite set of fonts to work with), I played around with the kerning for the header text.

## Reflection

Overall, I'm quite content with the skills that I've learned throughout these past four weeks and with my application of them to my design! I feel that I now have some foundational knowledge of graphic design principles and components (whereas beforehand I was playing things by ear, or I should say by eye), and I feel confident that going forward, my designs will continue to improve. I hope that one day, I'll be able to actually codea dashboard based off of this design!
