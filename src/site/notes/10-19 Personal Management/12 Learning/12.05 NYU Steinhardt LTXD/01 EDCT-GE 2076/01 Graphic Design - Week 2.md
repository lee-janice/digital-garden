## Feedback 

### From Xavier 

Excellent work with the grid!  Even the small position changes helped to clean the design and I like the triangle with the text even more.
_**Positive aspects:**_ Almost everything is connected to the grid. The few elements that are not (for example the "Filters" title text for the selection boxes) is just in the middle.  I agree that starting with the grid is always preferable, but the first time is better to battle with it to discover it usefulness. Also the use of the golden ratio seems to be a good choice.  It does not need to be a perfect fit, just a guide. Finally, I like your idea of the overlay for the menu.  It solve the space problem and it is clear that you can use it for navigation.
_**Things to improve:**_ Not much, really.  The red arrow for the menu will be easily misinterpreted by the users.  Try to use a more universal symbol such as the "hamburger" menu icon ☰.

### From PeerStudio

- I noticed that the text is large so that the audience can know that it's there and that the color indicates where you are in the page and the pages for the content is there and I can understand what's going on.

- Janice, this looks like a really cool project! I appreciate that you went outside your comfort zone to push some boundaries! While the "CS for Whom?" header is consistent with the sizing of the other pages, I do feel like it is competing with the triangle for attention. You might also play around with trying a smaller font size for the categories in the triangle. I love a good triangle, but it always feels like the longest word always goes in the smallest section! One other question I have is if, on the second page, the header is meant to say "Data," instead of "Capacity." If it's a sub-page within the Data section, maybe that could be shown somewhere or otherwise somehow indicated. I'm excited to see how this evolves! I really like the simplicity that the contrast affords, as well as the consistency with the triangle shape.

- First of all, I think this is such a cool idea. I love how you used this as an opportunity to connect our schoolwork to our job. I really appreciate the use of red to signify which page the user is on. I know this is just the wireframe, but I think this is a really effective method to continue using! The pyramid is a great visual and I am impressed by your use of scale, spacing, and typography. I also think the charts are a great format for this display of information. I love the tension built with the dramatic use of scale. To maintain a form of unity, though, I wonder what it would look like if the “More on CS4All Initiative, the Research Alliance, and this tool” on the third wireframe were aligned underneath the “About.” I think it could compliment the menu options on the left side. As previously mentioned, I think the spacing is generally visually appealing. If not done so already, I wonder how using the golden proportion as a framework would influence the design. It could bring everything together really nicely. You noted the use of triangular symbols to indicate drop-down menus, which I love. I wonder how else you can utilize the pyramid throughout the design? Maybe there are ways to feature it in subtle ways. I think it’s a really fun shape to play around with!

- I think it's great the you had the goal of pushing yourself out of your comfort zone on this! The typography is very strong and feels intentional with how bold it is. I also like that you used the red text to show where is user is within the available tabs. I would be interested in seeing how other colors might tie into the functionality of the page as well - the black/white/red work very well, but I think some pops of color throughout the page would provide even more contrast. Awesome work!

## Proportions 

> In this forum, please provide examples of interfaces (educational or not) that use any of the proportion rules seen in the videos.

I am a big fan of [this publication](https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/), which is an interactive article about interactive articles! In addition to just containing very pleasing and engaging content, it uses the "square proportions" rule in Figure 1 by displaying a tiled list of various interactive articles from around the web, and also (loosely) the "rule of thirds" by having the main article content in the center third of the screen, and auxiliary content on the left and right thirds of the screen. The layout also is symmetrical when there is a longer figure or table spanning across the content column, but asymmetrical when there is a smaller figure biting into the right side of the content area (which is nice and funky).

An article that is featured in the aforementioned one is [The Myth of the Impartial Machine](https://parametric.press/issue-01/the-myth-of-the-impartial-machine/), which is part of the magazine Parametric Press's first issue. It also follows the "rule of thirds" — the article content is displayed (approximately) on the two left-most thirds of the page, while the margin notes (yay for margin notes!) are placed on the right third of the page. There's also a decent amount of asymmetry going on in the header, with the repetitions of the words "Impartial Machine" overlapping one another. 

Edit: Here's another very cool website of a similar kind that posts visual essays! [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) and it uses somewhat of a square proportions rule, or at the very least a grid!

## Grids

> Show the invisible grid used in applications

I think that I did find the approximate grid used for the header of the article "The Myth of the Impartial Machine" — this grid has 18 columns and 6 rows. I will say that it was a little tricky to "reverse-engineer" the grid that is used for websites, so I'm not sure if this is the exact one that the designers had in mind or not! It's possible that they instead defined margins for the sides of the content, and then used a grid arrange the elements within the content area.

# Video Notes

## Proportions

### Symmetry

- Symmetry (i.e., being on a centered axis) is a traditional form
- It can communicate quality, strength, and classical ideals
- However, it can be expected and mediocre

### Asymmetry

- Asymmetrical layouts can be modern, edgy, or avant-garde
- They usually feel more casual and energetic than symmetrical layouts
- Placing the forms can be like balancing things on a mobile — the goal is to make things feel like they are in movement 
- It's still a good idea to try to work within a structure (like a grid) or a consistent scale

### Square proportions

- Putting images in their own square or combinations of squares conveys a sense of order

### Golden section

- This is the oldest proportional system that we use today
- It's based on the Fibonacci sequence
- It can be used as a guide to place content on a page, as the basis of a proportion of a book, etc.
- To use it, overlay it onto your design and use it as a grid to size and place text or images 

### Rule of thirds

- Using the rule of thirds will force the user to question, is this symmetrical or asymmetrical? Is it balanced? and engage them further with your design 

## Grids

### Anatomy of a grid

- **Margins** separate the content from the edge of the page
- **Columns** position your content vertically
- **Gutters** provide space between the columns 
- **Hanglines** provide a guide to hang content consistently, horizontally 
- **Markers** are elements that remain the same on every page, like running feet, running heads, and page numbers

### Different types of grids

- Classic book grids are the simplest one column grids (no more than 52 words in one line)
- Corporate communications often use a multi column grid structure 
- Magazines usually use several grids within a single issue 
- Infographics work best with more complex grids
- Website grids are more flexible and varied 

### Choosing the best grid format 

You should ask yourself: 

- What is the content? 
- Who is the viewer? 
- In what context will this appear? 

Rotating grid structures can interrupt the viewers' expectations 

### How to create a grid 

- You can draw a grid structure by hand first
- A pica is a graphical unit of measure 

### Website grids 

- A 12-column grid is a good basis for website design
