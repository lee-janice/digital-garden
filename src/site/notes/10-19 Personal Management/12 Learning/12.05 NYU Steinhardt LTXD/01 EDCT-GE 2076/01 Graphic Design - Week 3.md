## Feedback 

### From Xavier 

The little additions contribute positively to the overall design.  Great work!

_**Positive aspects**_: The subtle use of colors (semi-opaque text at the top, and text-line at the bottom) is very elegant.  It add just the right amount of color without being distracting.  I also agree that Arial is not the best font to use, but you need to adjust to the guidelines (and subverting them as you did with the iterative elements).  I do not think that the design lost any of the clarity or its minimalism with the changes.  I also really like what you did with the menu.

_**Things to improve:**_  Add a little touch of color to the menu, maybe a very small circle of color before the name of the page when it is selected, hovered over.  Apart from that, I think your design is more than ready.

## Typography

Good typography usage will enhance and amplify the meaning of text. 
- Good type should visually communicate its message (e.g., highway signage and prescription labels)

### Terminology

- Type sits along a line called a baseline; it forms the basis of other measurements
- The x-height determines the height relationship between the upper and lower case characters 
- A font is a delivery mechanism for a complete collection of a set of letterforms (e.g., Helvetica Regular, Helvetica Bold); like a cookie cutter
- The typeface is the design of the letterforms, known as the characters or glyphs; like the cookies the font makes
- A character are the letters you type; a glyph is the character that is displayed, all glyphs have invisible boxes that surround them

### Type anatomy

- Ascenders move above the x-height, descenders move below the baseline
- The curvy bit of a letter (like in b, d, p) is called the bowl; the negative space inside is called the counter (open counter if it isn't enclosed)
- Qs have a tail, Ks have a leg and an arm, h has a shoulder, e has an eye, g has an ear, s has a spine, f has a cross stroke or a bar
- A terminal is the end of any stroke

### Type classifications 

- The classifications at Typekit are divided into 8 classes 
	- Sans serif is the type without serif
	- Slab serifs are the wider, bolder, heavier versions of serifs 
	- Formal and casual script are based on the strokes made by pens 
	- Blackletter is based on the earliest printing typefaces 
	- Monospaced are fonts with characters that occupy the same character width 
	- Handwritten is made to look handwritten
	- Decorative is large display fonts 

### Ligatures

- Ligatures refer to two or more characters replaced by a specially designed single character to improve the look of characters that may appear to collide
- Illustrator/Photoshop may automatically replace these for you in text 

### Type measurement

- There are 72 points in one inch 
- There are 12 points in one pica 

### Character properties

- The leading is the distance between lines
- The kerning is the spacing relationship between pairs of characters 
- Tracking increases or decreases spacing between all characters
- Horizontal and vertical scaling shouldn't be used 
- Baseline shift will let you move the characters up and down

### Paragraph properties

- Alignment will change the alignment of the text 
- Justification will spread the text evenly across the column 
- Indent will indent the first/last/etc. line in a paragraph
- Spacing before or after text 
- Drop cap will make the first n characters in a paragraph very big and spanning multiple lines

### Selecting type and type guidelines

- You should think of the subject matter itself, the audience, and the medium 
- Contrast is important 
- Headlines should be large and prominent 
- A typeface that is not legible is not a true typeface
- Limit the number of typefaces to three at most 
- Never set the text/body of a document in capitals 
- Keep your measure/line between 45-75 characters
- Readability is one of the main purposes of typography; use x-heights and spacing to optimize readability
- Think really hard about fully-justified text 
- Body text should be between 10-12 points in print and 15-25 on the web
- Interlinear space on text should be at least 120% of the text size and 145% at most
- Rules are made to be bent and broken 

### Type crimes

- Horizontally/vertically spaced type
- Double space following a period 
- Double hyphen in the place of an em dash 
- Stacked roman lowercase 
- All the fonts, all the time 

### Type combinations

- Serif typeface for the body, sans serif for headers
- You may want to combine typefaces from the same time period, same designer, similar body heights, or opposites 

## Color

### How color shapes meaning

- Color is defined by other colors in the image 
- Some colors can be perceived with a universal message, others are cultural, others are personal

### Color components

- Hues are identified by their angle around the color wheel 
- Saturation is how intense the color is
- Tone is the luminosity/brightness of the color (shadow/black to tints/white)
- Warm colors appear to move close to you, cool colors appear to recede 
- Monochrome, duotone, tritones, quadtones are based on 1, 2, 3, and 4 hues

### Color harmonies

- Monochromatic uses a single hue
- Shades adds black to a color
- Complimentary are opposites on the color rule
- Analogous use hues that are 30 degrees from the base color

### RGB and CMYK

- RGB is an additive, energy-based model where you start with black, and the maximum intensity of red, green, and blue give you white 
- CMYK is a subtractive, pigment-based model where you start with white, and cyan, magenta, yellow, and black gives you black
