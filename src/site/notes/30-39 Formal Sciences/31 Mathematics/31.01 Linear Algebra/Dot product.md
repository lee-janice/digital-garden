# Summary 

## Algebraic definition

The dot product is defined by $v \cdot w = \Sigma_{i=1}^n v_i w_i = v_1 w_1 + v_2 w_2 + \ldots + v_n w_n$.

## Geometric definition 

The dot product is defined by $v \cdot w = \lVert a \rVert \lVert b \rVert \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $v$ and $w$.

## Intuitive definition 

The dot product $v \cdot w$ is the length of the projection of $v$ onto $w$ scaled by the length of $w$. 
- When $w$ is a unit vector, $v \cdot w$ is the length of the component of $v$ that is in the direction of $w$.

The dot product $v \cdot w$ is the area of the parallelogram $v, w'$ where $w'$ is $w'$ rotated by 90 degrees.
