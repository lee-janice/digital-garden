# Reading notes

**Echecrates (E):** Were you with Socrates when he drank the poison? 
- **Phaedo (P):** I was there myself. 
- **E:** What did he say before he died? And how did he die? 
- **P:** Being there was an astonishing experience. He appeared happy and died nobly without fear. I felt a strange mix of pleasure and pain as I reflected that he was about to die — we all did. 
- **E:** What was the conversation about? 
- **P:** I will try to tell you from the beginning. 

> We gathered early at the prison, because the ship from Delos had arrived, signaling that Socrates would die today. When we went into his cell, he was released from his chains and Xanthippe (his wife) cried out, saying that this would be the last time that Socrates and us will speak. 
> Socrates told Crito to have someone take her home, and she was led away crying. 

**Socrates (S):** *(rubbing his leg)* What a strange thing that which men call pleasure seems to be, and how astonishing the relation it has with pain! A man cannot have both at the same time; yet, if he pursues and catches one, he is bound to catch the other also. This seems to be happening to me: my bonds caused pain in my leg, and now pleasure seems to be following. 
**Cebes (C):** You reminded me: Evenus asked me what caused you to write poetry after you came to prison, when you never had composed any poetry before, putting Aesop's fables into verse and composing a hymn to Apollo. 
**S:** My dreams told me: "Socrates, practice and cultivate the arts". In the past, I believed that it was telling me to do what I was doing: practicing the art of philosophy (the highest kind of art). But after my trial, I thought that in the case that my dream was telling me to practice popular art, I should obey and compose poetry. 
- I realized that a poet must compose fables, not arguments. Because I'm no teller of fables, I took Aesop's and put them into verse. 
- It seems that I am dying today; tell Evenus that if he is wise, he will follow me as soon as possible. If he is a philosopher, he will be willing; yet perhaps he will not take his own life, for people say that is not right. 
**C:** Why do people say that it isn't right for one to kill themselves? 
**S:** There is the explanation that is put into the language of the mysteries; that men are put in a kind of prison, and that one must not free oneself nor run away. 
- This is not easy to understand fully; however, wouldn't you say that the gods are our guardians and we are one of their possessions? 
- And wouldn't you be angry if one of possessions killed itself without your permission, and wouldn't you punish it?
- Then, one shouldn't kill oneself before a god indicates some necessity to do so, like in this occasion.
**C:** That makes sense. But that philosophers should be ready and willing to die seems strange — that the wisest of men should not resent leaving this service of the best of masters, the gods, because a wise man cannot believe that he would look after himself better when he is free. 

> Socrates seemed pleased at Cebes' argument.

## To practice philosophy is to practice for dying and death. Further, if one is to ever attain true knowledge, one must escape the body and observe things with the soul by itself.

**S:** I should be wrong to not resent dying if I didn't believe that I would first go to other wise and good gods, and then to men who have died and are better than these here. I have hope that some future awaits men after death, as we have been told for years; a much better future for the good than for the wicked. 
- I am afraid that people do not realize that the one aim of those who practice philosophy in the proper manner is to practice for dying and death. 
- If this is true, it would be strange if they were eager for this all their lives and then resented it once it is time. 
- But never mind them; do we believe that there is such a thing as death? 
**Simmias (Sim):** Yes. 
**S:** Death is nothing else than the separation of soul from the body. 
- A philosopher should not be concerned with the pleasures of the body; it is an obstacle in the search for knowledge. It is in reasoning that reality becomes clear to the soul. 
	- The soul reasons best when it is as far removed from the bodily senses as possible in the search for reality. 
	- And we say that there are such things as the Just, the Beautiful, and the Good; have you ever grasped any of these with your eyes? If anyone grasps these things, it would be he who approaches them with thought alone. 
	- All these things would make true philosophers believe that there is something like a path to guide us out of our confusion, because as long as we have a body, we shall never attain what we desire — the truth. 
	- Only the body and its desires cause war, civil discord, and battles; and worst of all, if we do attend to the body, it makes itself present everywhere in our investigations and prevents us from seeing the truth. 
	- So, if we are ever to attain true knowledge, we must escape the body and observe things with the soul by itself. 
- If it's impossible to obtain pure knowledge with the body, either 
	- (a) we can never attain knowledge, or
	- (b) we can only do so after death — for only then is the soul apart from the body. 
- And while we live, we should refrain from association with the body as much as possible; for it is not permitted for the impure to attain the pure. 
- Then, there is good hope that I will acquire true knowledge where I'm going, if anywhere. 
- Further, isn't purification to separate the soul as far as possible from the body — and this separation is death? And this separation is also the preoccupation of the philosophers?
	- So, it would be ridiculous for a man to train in life for a state as close to death as possible, and then resent it when it comes.
	- In fact, those who practice philosophy in the right way fear death least of all: would a true lover of wisdom, who knows he would never find it until after death, not gladly die? Any man who resents death was not a lover of wisdom, but a lover of the body. 
- The qualities of courage and moderation are strange among those who do not practice philosophy and consider death a great evil. 
	- The brave face death for fear of greater evils: fear and terror make them brave.
	- The moderate fear to be deprived of other pleasures which they desire. 
- But I fear that his is not the right exchange to attain virtue, to exchange pleasures for pleasure, pains for pains, and fears for fears, the greater for less like coins, but that the only valid currency for which all these things should be exchanged is wisdom. With this we have real courage and moderation and justice and, in a word, true virtue, with wisdom, whether pleasures and fears and all such things be present or absent. 

## All things come to be in this way: opposites from opposites. Thus, the dead must come from the living, and vice versa; meaning that the soul must be somewhere where it can come back again. 

**C:** Everything else you said was excellent; but men would find what you said about the soul hard to believe: they think that after it leaves the body, it is destroyed and dissolves.
**S:** Let's examine this matter in this manner: whether or not the souls of men who have died exist in the underworld. 
- Recall the ancient theory that souls arriving in the underworld come from here, and souls arriving here come from the underworld. This implies that our souls must exist there. 
- However, if this theory is not true, let us see if this is true: that all things come to be from their opposites (if they have one) and nowhere else. 
	- For example, something smaller must come from something larger; the weaker comes from the stronger; the swifter from the slower. 
	- All things come to be in this way — opposites from opposites. 
 
 > [!warning]
 > This seems like very dualist thinking; also, not all processes are reversible

- Furthermore, between each of these pairs of opposites, there are two processes: from one to the other and from the other to the one. 
- Therefore, if there are opposites, they come to be from one another. 
- Then, being dead is the opposite of being alive, implying that they come to be from one another. 
	- Living things come from the dead. 
	- Therefore, our souls exist in the underworld: there must be an opposite process to dying, which is becoming (coming to life again), meaning that the soul must be somewhere where it can come back again.
- If the two processes of becoming did not always balance each other out as if they were in a circle, but rather proceeded in a straight line, ultimately everything would be in the same state and cease to become, and everything would ultimately be dead. 

> [!note]
> I'm reminded of the heat death hypothesis of the universe and of entropy for some reason

 > [!warning]
 > There is a cycle of life (dying and becoming), but in a physical / biological sense

## Learning is nothing but recollection; therefore, our soul must have existed before we were born. This statement only holds true if realities like the Just and Beautiful and Good exist, but their existence is evident. 

**C:** Furthermore, if the theory that you often mention is true — that learning is nothing but recollection, our soul must have existed before it took on this human form[^1]. 
- There is an excellent argument for this theory: that when men are questioned correctly, they always give the right answer of their own accord. They could not do so if they did not possess the knowledge inside of them. 
**S:** If anyone recollects anything, he must have known it before. 
- When a man perceives one thing and also thinks of another, he recollects the second thing. 
- This recollection can be brought about by both similar and dissimilar things. 
- When it is caused by similar things, one must also consider whether the similarity is deficient or complete. 
- Consider the case when we say two things are Equal. 
	- We acquired the knowledge of Equal from seeing things that appear (but are not actually) equal — this is deficient and not the Equal. 
	- However, one must have prior knowledge of that to which he says something is like, but deficiently so. 
	- Therefore, we must have possessed knowledge of the Equal before the time when we saw equal objects and realized that all objects strive to be like the Equal but are deficient in this. 
	- This conception derives from sense perception and cannot enter the mind in any other way. 
	- Then before we begin to perceive, we must have possessed knowledge of the Equal, but we begin to perceive right after birth; so, we must have possessed it before birth, and learning is the recovery of this knowledge and should be called recollection.
 
 > [!warning]
 > Why do these concepts have to exist before humans have thought of them? Also, what about information / "knowledge" passed on evolutionarily / through genetics?
 
- So, one of two things are true: 
	- (1) we are born with true knowledge, and all of us know it throughout life, or 
	- (2) those who learn are really only recollecting. 
- Not everyone has knowledge of these things, so they recollect what they once know. 
- Our souls must have acquired this knowledge before we were born; thus, our souls must have existed apart from our body and it must have had intelligence. 
- If the realities like the Beautiful and the Good and the like do not exist, then our argument is futile, but it is evident that these do exist.

**Sim:** I think sufficient proof has been given that our soul has existed before we were born; but it is not yet proven that it will continue after we die.
