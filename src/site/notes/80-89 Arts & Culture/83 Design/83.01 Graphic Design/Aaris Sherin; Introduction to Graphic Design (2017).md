## Chapter 1: Overview of the field

Graphic design is the process or practice of combining visual material, usually text, imagery, and other elements, to communicate a message or to create an experience for an audience. Successful design occurs when a message or experience is optimally expressed. 

Graphic designers act as intermediaries between the client and end user or audience, with responsibility to both groups. 

Rules can be helpful as a tool to help designers successfully give form to concepts. However, the designer reserves the right to decide when to maintain and when to break free of structure. 

Inspiration is key: looking at other people's work is one of the best ways to develop an understanding of how visuals and text can be combined to produce effective design. 

## Chapter 2: Concepts and ideas

### Design process overview

- brief/assignment > research/strategy > development/ideation > revision > implementation/production

A design project begins with the brief or assignment, which tells the designer:
- what needs to be accomplished,
- what kind of people the design outputs should target, 
- how much time the designer has to work on a project, and 
- specifics about the budget. 

Then, the designer will need to conduct research to find out about:
- the client,
- the target audience, and 
- the context where the final output will exist. 

Then, the designer engages in brainstorming and concept development, then ideation and visual explorations. 

The final step is to produce the design.
