# Summary

The [Dewey Decimal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification), invented by Melvil Dewey in 1876, is a library classification system that categorizes books based on subject matter. It allows the user to identify a particular book's location relative to other books in the library.
