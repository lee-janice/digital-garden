# Summary

The [Johnny.Decimal system ](https://johnnydecimal.com/) is an information classification system created by Johnny Noble in 2021. It resembles the [[70-79 Interdisciplinary Studies/73 Information Science/73.02 Knowledge Management/Dewey Decimal classification\|Dewey Decimal]] and [[70-79 Interdisciplinary Studies/73 Information Science/73.02 Knowledge Management/Universal Decimal classification\|Universal Decimal classification]] systems in that it utilizes hierarchical numbering (with 10 classes per level) to define categories of concepts; however, it does not have established categories. Instead, it allows the user to define their own categories to fit their individual needs.
