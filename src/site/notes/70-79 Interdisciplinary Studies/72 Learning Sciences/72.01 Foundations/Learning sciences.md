The [learning sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_sciences) is the interdisciplinary pursuit of studying deep, connected learning and the environments in which learning occurs; designing software, pedagogies, and other materials that promote deep understanding; and developing methodologies to study learning [[kolodnerLearningSciencesPresent2004 \| (Kolodner, 2004)]]. 
# History 

The learning sciences began in the 1980s as an offshoot of [[70-79 Interdisciplinary Studies/71 Cognitive Science/71.01 Cognitive Science/Cognitive science\|Cognitive science]] â€” largely as a consequence of the [[70-79 Interdisciplinary Studies/71 Cognitive Science/71.01 Cognitive Science/Cognitive revolution\|Cognitive revolution]], which inspired more interdisciplinary investigations of the nature of human knowledge. Some cognitive scientists began to feel that the complexity of the real world was not being accounted for by current research, and those at the intersection of [[Artificial intelligence\|Artificial intelligence]] and education were working to design software to promote better learning in real-world scenarios. Key persons of this period included: 

- [[70-79 Interdisciplinary Studies/72 Learning Sciences/72.01 Foundations/Seymour Papert\|Seymour Papert]], who was working on the Logo programming language
- [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay), who was developing the DynaBook, a precursor to the personal laptop
- [Roy Pea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Pea), who was investigating uses of hypertext, word processing, and other general-purpose software programs to support learning
- [Ann Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Brown), who was studying how to promote deep and lasting learning

People began to formalize spaces for this work: [Roger Schank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Schank) started the Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern; there was the Institute for Research on Learning at Xerox; and Vanderbilt's Center for Learning and Technology.
