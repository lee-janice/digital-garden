>Learning: From Speculation to Science ([15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=15&annotation=8ZNJRQWF)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>The revolution in the study of the mind that has occurred in the last three or four decades has important implications for education. As we illustrate, a new theory of learning is coming into focus that leads to very different approaches to the design of curriculum, teaching, and assessment than those often found in schools today. ([15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=15&annotation=3AY47MK4)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>• Research from cognitive psychology has increased understanding of the nature of competent performance and the principles of knowledge organization that underlie people’s abilities to solve problems in a wide variety of areas, including mathematics, science, literature, social studies, and history. • Developmental researchers have shown that young children understand a great deal about basic principles of biology and physical causality, about number, narrative, and personal intent, and that these capabilities make it possible to create innovative curricula that introduce important concepts for advanced reasoning at early ages. • Research on learning and transfer has uncovered important principles for structuring learning experiences that enable people to use what they have learned in new settings. • Work in social psychology, cognitive psychology, and anthropology is making clear that all learning takes place in settings that have particular sets of cultural and social norms and expectations and that these settings influence learning and transfer in powerful ways. • Neuroscience is beginning to provide evidence for many principles of learning that have emerged from laboratory research, and it is showing how learning changes the physical structure of the brain and, with it, the functional organization of the brain. • Collaborative studies of the design and evaluation of learning environments, among cognitive and developmental psychologists and educators, are yielding new knowledge about the nature of learning and teaching as it takes place in a variety of settings. In addition, researchers are discovering ways to learn from the “wisdom of practice” that comes from successful teachers who can share their expertise. • Emerging technologies are leading to the development of many new opportunities to guide and enhance learning that were unimagined even a few years ago. ([16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=16&annotation=V9AFIDH7)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>In the early part of the twentieth century, education focused on the acquisition of literacy skills: simple reading, writing, and calculating. It was not the general rule for educational systems to train people to think and read critically, to express themselves clearly and persuasively, to solve complex problems in science and mathematics. Now, at the end of the century, these aspects of high literacy are required of almost everyone in order to successfully negotiate the complexities of contemporary life. ([16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=16&annotation=2ZMC8CUE)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Above all, information and knowledge are growing at a far more rapid rate than ever before in the history of humankind. As Nobel laureate Herbert Simon wisely stated, the meaning of “knowing” has shifted from being able to remember and repeat information to being able to find and use it (Simon, 1996). More than ever, the sheer magnitude of human knowledge renders its coverage by education an impossibility; rather, the goal of education is better conceived as helping students develop the intellectual tools and learning strategies needed to acquire the knowledge that allows people to think productively about history, science and technology, social phenomena, mathematics, and the arts. ([17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=17&annotation=XRBSVLZT))

>FOCUS: PEOPLE, SCHOOLS, AND THE POTENTIAL TO LEARN ([17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=17&annotation=4C6UF3W4)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>New ideas about ways to facilitate learning—and about who is most capable of learning—can powerfully affect the quality of people’s lives. At different points in history, scholars have worried that formal educational environments have been better at selecting talent than developing it (see, e.g., Bloom, 1964). ([17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=17&annotation=GK2F5Z22)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Learning research suggests that there are new ways to introduce students to traditional subjects, such as mathematics, science, history and literature, and that these new approaches make it possible for the majority of individuals to develop a deep understanding of important subject matter. ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=18&annotation=ZQAHLY9Z)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCIENCE OF LEARNING ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=18&annotation=XFSSYBNF)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>This report builds on research that began in the latter part of the nineteenth century—the time in history at which systematic attempts were made to study the human mind through scientific methods. Before then, such study was the province of philosophy and theology. Some of the most influential early work was done in Leipzig in the laboratory of Wilhelm Wundt, who with his colleagues tried to subject human consciousness to precise analysis—mainly by asking subjects to reflect on their thought processes through introspection. ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=18&annotation=4AFMNJUA))

>Leipzig in the laboratory of Wilhelm Wundt, ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=18&annotation=QMLQZQZ3)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>An extremely influential article, published by John B. Watson in 1913, provides a glimpse of the behaviorist credo: . . . all schools of psychology except that of behaviorism claim that “consciousness” is the subject-matter of psychology. Behaviorism, on the contrary, holds that the subject matter of human psychology is the behavior or activities of the human being. Behaviorism claims that “consciousness” is neither a definable nor a useable concept; that it is merely another word for the “soul” of more ancient times. The old psychology is thus dominated by a kind of subtle religious philosophy (p. 1). ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=18&annotation=CNBTJIY8))

> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>Drawing on the empiricist tradition, behaviorists conceptualized learning as a process of forming connections between stimuli and responses. Motivation to learn was assumed to be driven primarily by drives, such as hunger, and the availability of external forces, such as rewards and punishments (e.g., Thorndike, 1913; Skinner, 1950).

> [!results]+ Note  
>A limitation of early behaviorism stemmed from its focus on observable stimulus conditions and the behaviors associated with those conditions. This orientation made it difficult to study such phenomena as understanding, reasoning, and thinking—phenomena that are of paramount importance for education. ([20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=20&annotation=BI3IGP99)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Over time, radical behaviorism (often called “Behaviorism with a Capital B”) gave way to a more moderate form of behaviorism (“behaviorism with a small b”) that preserved the scientific rigor of using behavior as data, but also allowed hypotheses about internal “mental” states when these became necessary to explain various phenomena (e.g., Hull, 1943; Spence, 1942). ([20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=20&annotation=Y8U7A6QU)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>In the late 1950s, the complexity of understanding humans and their environments became increasingly apparent, and a new field emergedcognitive science. ([20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=20&annotation=YR2MUHQF)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>From its inception, cognitive science approached learning from a multidisciplinary perspective that included anthropology, linguistics, philosophy, developmental psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and several branches of psychology (Norman, 1980,1993; Newell and Simon, 1972). ([20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=20&annotation=AA7LXGDP)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>Learning with Understanding ([20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=20&annotation=9E8KLNAU)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>One of the hallmarks of the new science of learning is its emphasis on learning with understanding. Intuitively, understanding is good, but it has been difficult to study from a scientific perspective. At the same time, students often have limited opportunities to understand or make sense of topics because many curricula have emphasized memory ([20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=20&annotation=XHJ8KVQL)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>The new science of learning does not deny that facts are important for thinking and problem solving. Research on expertise in areas such as chess, history, science, and mathematics demonstrate that experts’ abilities to think and solve problems depend strongly on a rich body of knowledge about subject matter (e.g., Chase and Simon, 1973; Chi et al., 1981; deGroot, 1965). However, the research also shows clearly that “usable knowledge” is not the same as a mere list of disconnected facts. Experts’ knowledge is connected and organized around important concepts (e.g., Newton’s second law of motion); it is “conditionalized” to specify the contexts in which it is applicable; it supports understanding and transfer (to other contexts) rather than only the ability to remember. ([21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=21&annotation=IKJPFAXB)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>Pre-Existing Knowledge ([22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=22&annotation=828QFSVF)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>An emphasis on understanding leads to one of the primary characteristics of the new science of learning: its focus on the processes of knowing (e.g., Piaget, 1978; Vygotsky, 1978). Humans are viewed as goal-directed agents who actively seek information. They come to formal education with a range of prior knowledge, skills, beliefs, and concepts that significantly influence what they notice about the environment and how they organize and interpret it. This, in turn, affects their abilities to remember, reason, solve problems, and acquire new knowledge. ([22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=22&annotation=6J64EWPM)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>In the most general sense, the contemporary view of learning is that people construct new knowledge and understandings based on what they already know and believe (e.g., Cobb, 1994; Piaget, 1952, 1973a,b, 1977, 1978; Vygotsky, 1962, 1978). ([22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=22&annotation=KLYKCCUY)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>A logical extension of the view that new knowledge must be constructed from existing knowledge is that teachers need to pay attention to the incomplete understandings, the false beliefs, and the naive renditions of concepts that learners bring with them to a given subject. ([22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=22&annotation=9AUIXMQC)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>A common misconception regarding “constructivist” theories of knowing (that existing knowledge is used to build new knowledge) is that teachers should never tell students anything directly but, instead, should always allow them to construct knowledge for themselves. This perspective confuses a theory of pedagogy (teaching) with a theory of knowing. ([23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=23&annotation=LNW2JYI7)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>Constructivists assume that all knowledge is constructed from previous knowledge, irrespective of how one is taught (e.g., Cobb, 1994)—even listening to a lecture involves active attempts to construct new knowledge. ([23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=23&annotation=6GQ9QU6Y)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Nevertheless, there are times, usually after people have first grappled with issues on their own, that “teaching by telling” can work extremely well (e.g., Schwartz and Bransford, 1998). ([23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=23&annotation=5QC22K4C)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>There is a good deal of evidence that learning is enhanced when teachers pay attention to the knowledge and beliefs that learners bring to a learning task, use this knowledge as a starting point for new instruction, and monitor students’ changing conceptions as instruction proceeds. ([23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=23&annotation=NHAA4ULV)) 


> [!disagreement]+ Disagreement  
>For example, sixth graders in a suburban school who were given inquiry-based physics instruction were shown to do better on conceptual physics problems than eleventh and twelfth grade physics students taught by conventional methods in the same school system.

> [!disagreement]+ Disagreement  
>New curricula for young children have also demonstrated results that are extremely promising: for example, a new approach to teaching geometry helped second-grade children learn to represent and visualize three-dimensional forms in ways that exceeded the skills of a comparison group of undergraduate students at a leading university (Lehrer and Chazan, 1998). ([24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=24&annotation=TAYJFXCZ))

>New developments in the science of learning also emphasize the importance of helping people take control of their own learning. ([24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=24&annotation=UNZAFC6M)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>Metacognition refers to people’s abilities to predict their performances on various tasks (e.g., how well they will be able to remember various stimuli) and to monitor their current levels of mastery and understanding (e.g., Brown, 1975; Flavell, 1973). ([24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=24&annotation=L5M7SJ6W)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Teaching practices congruent with a metacognitive approach to learning include those that focus on sensemaking, self-assessment, and reflection on what worked and what needs improving. ([24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=24&annotation=49YL23GM)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>Implications for Education ([25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=25&annotation=4K6BCGTJ)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Overall, the new science of learning is beginning to provide knowledge to improve significantly people’s abilities to become active learners who seek to understand complex subject matter and are better prepared to transfer what they have learned to new problems and settings. Making this happen is a major challenge (e.g., Elmore et al., 1996), but it is not impossible. ([25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=25&annotation=K8MCIGVR))

>An Evolving Science ([26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=26&annotation=SJW7EMED)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>This volume synthesizes the scientific basis of learning. The scientific achievements include a fuller understanding of: (1) memory and the structure of knowledge; (2) problem solving and reasoning; (3) the early foundations of learning; (4) regulatory processes that govern learning, including metacognition; and (5) how symbolic thinking emerges from the culture and community of the learner. ([26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=26&annotation=LD9FBP6V)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>The scientific bases, while not superficial in themselves, do represent only a surface level of a complete understanding of the subject. ([26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=26&annotation=MQZHR2AX)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>As scientists continue to study learning, new research procedures and methodologies are emerging that are likely to alter current theoretical conceptions of learning ([26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=26&annotation=SG7XWUWD)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>Key Findings ([26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=26&annotation=K7397EWG)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>1. Students come to the classroom with preconceptions about how the world works. If their initial understanding is not engaged, they may fail to grasp the new concepts and information that are ([26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=26&annotation=P2CEUS2Z)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>taught, or they may learn them for purposes of a test but revert to their preconceptions outside the classroom. ([27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=27&annotation=CLES6MYQ)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Children begin in preschool years to develop sophisticated understandings (whether accurate or not) of the phenomena around them (Wellman, 1990). Those initial understandings can have a powerful effect on the integration of new concepts and information. ([27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=27&annotation=SCLJ8NUR)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>Despite their training, college physics students, like the elementary schoolchildren, aimed the moving dynaturtle directly at the target, failing to take momentum into account. Further investigation of one college student who participated in the study revealed that she knew the relevant physical properties and formulas, yet, in the context of the game, she fell back on her untrained conception of how the physical world works. ([28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=28&annotation=BX6VR38A)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>2. To develop competence in an area of inquiry, students must: (a) have a deep foundation of factual knowledge, (b) understand facts and ideas in the context of a conceptual framework, and (c) organize knowledge in ways that facilitate retrieval and application. ([28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=28&annotation=7L5CYLGU)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>This principle emerges from research that compares the performance of experts and novices and from research on learning and transfer. Experts, regardless of the field, always draw on a richly structured information base; they are not just “good thinkers” or “smart people.” ([28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=28&annotation=V5UC3ZJP)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>But knowledge of a large set of disconnected facts is not sufficient. To develop competence in an area of inquiry, students must have opportunities to learn with understanding. ([28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=28&annotation=WAXT7DTY)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>A pronounced difference between experts and novices is that experts’ command of concepts shapes ([28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=28&annotation=RHYKBY4V)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>their understanding of new information: it allows them to see patterns, relationships, or discrepancies that are not apparent to novices. They do not necessarily have better overall memories than other people. But their conceptual understanding allows them to extract a level of meaning from information that is not apparent to novices, and this helps them select and remember relevant information. Experts are also able to fluently access relevant knowledge because their understanding of subject matter allows them to quickly identify what is relevant. Hence, their attention is not overtaxed by complex events. ([29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=29&annotation=KH9M2DZY)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>Geography can be used to illustrate the manner in which expertise is organized around principles that support understanding. A student can learn to fill in a map by memorizing states, cities, countries, etc., and can complete the task with a high level of accuracy. But if the boundaries are removed, the problem becomes much more difficult. There are no concepts supporting the student’s information. An expert who understands that borders often developed because natural phenomena (like mountains or water bodies) separated people, and that large cities often arose in locations that allowed for trade (along rivers, large lakes, and at coastal ports) will easily outperform the novice. The more developed the conceptual understanding of the needs of cities and the resource base that drew people to them, the more meaningful the map becomes. Students can become more expert if the geographical information they are taught is placed in the appropriate conceptual framework. ([29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=29&annotation=HH3P9EHW)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>A key finding in the learning and transfer literature is that organizing information into a conceptual framework allows for greater “transfer”; that is, it allows the student to apply what was learned in new situations and to learn related information more quickly ([29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=29&annotation=28UPVZBZ)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>3. A “metacognitive” approach to instruction can help students learn to take control of their own learning by defining learning goals and monitoring their progress in achieving them. ([30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=30&annotation=6IEVAGVP)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>In research with experts who were asked to verbalize their thinking as they worked, it was revealed that they monitored their own understanding carefully, making note of when additional information was required for understanding, whether new information was consistent with what they already knew, and what analogies could be drawn that would advance their understanding. ([30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=30&annotation=PE3DLULL)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>These meta-cognitive monitoring activities are an important component of what is called adaptive expertise (Hatano and Inagaki, 1986). ([30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=30&annotation=VVRVGSNT)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>Implications for Teaching ([31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=31&annotation=XEE4GAW6)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>1. Teachers must draw out and work with the preexisting understandings that their students bring with them. ([31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=31&annotation=GT2A2HAA)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>The model of the child as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge provided by the teacher must be replaced. ([31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=31&annotation=72DNMYQ5)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>The roles for assessment must be expanded beyond the traditional concept of testing. The use of frequent formative assessment helps make students’ thinking visible to themselves, their peers, and their teacher. ([31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=31&annotation=JQYW5FGN)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Schools of education must provide beginning teachers with opportunities to learn: (a) to recognize predictable preconceptions of students that make the mastery of particular subject matter challenging, (b) to draw out preconceptions that are not predictable, and (c) to work with preconceptions so that children build on them, challenge them and, when appropriate, replace them. ([32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=32&annotation=DMRSZXC6)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>2. Teachers must teach some subject matter in depth, providing many examples in which the same concept is at work and providing a firm foundation of factual knowledge. ([32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=32&annotation=3H6MKJ5B)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Superficial coverage of all topics in a subject area must be replaced with in-depth coverage of fewer topics that allows key concepts in that discipline to be understood. ([32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=32&annotation=Q6GSB8JJ)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Teachers must come to teaching with the experience of in-depth study of the subject area themselves. ([32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=32&annotation=34LFXNIV)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Assessment for purposes of accountability (e.g., statewide assessments) must test deep understanding rather than surface knowledge. ([32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=32&annotation=JHULLATF)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Unless new assessment tools are aligned with new approaches to teaching, the latter are unlikely to muster support among the schools and their constituent parents. This goal is as important as it is difficult to achieve. ([32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=32&annotation=TDFTG9BQ)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>3. The teaching of metacognitive skills should be integrated into the curriculum in a variety of subject areas. ([33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=33&annotation=VVRZ4KZG)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Integration of metacognitive instruction with discipline-based learning can enhance student achievement and develop in students the ability to learn independently. ([33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=33&annotation=Q669KT2Y)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Developing strong metacognitive strategies and learning to teach those strategies in a classroom environment should be standard features of the curriculum in schools of education. ([33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=33&annotation=E4MMQT2S))

>Bringing Order to Chaos ([33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=33&annotation=3MBYN6CY)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Asking which teaching technique is best is analogous to asking which tool is best—a hammer, a screwdriver, a knife, or pliers. In teaching as in carpentry, the selection of tools depends on the task at hand and the materials one is working with.

> [!results]+ Note  
>If, instead, the point of departure is a core set of learning principles, then the selection of teaching strategies (mediated, of course, by subject matter, grade level, and desired outcome) can be purposeful. The many possibilities then become a rich set of opportunities from which a teacher constructs an instructional program rather than a chaos of competing alternatives.

>1. Schools and classrooms must be learner centered. ([35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=35&annotation=DCNX5WNK)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Cultural differences can affect students’ comfort level in working collaboratively versus individually, and they are reflected in the background knowledge students bring to a new learning situation (Moll et al., 1993). ([35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=35&annotation=UI25QDT3))

> [!results]+ Note  
>Learner-centered teachers present students with “just manageable difficulties”—that is, challenging enough to maintain engagement, but not so difficult as to lead to discouragement. ([36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=36&annotation=YA6CIMR9)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>2. To provide a knowledge-centered classroom environment, attention must be given to what is taught (information, subject matter), why it is taught (understanding), and what competence or mastery looks like. ([36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=36&annotation=HDER8QJX))

>Many curricula fail to support learning with understanding because they present too many disconnected facts in too short a time—the “mile wide, inch deep” problem. Tests often reinforce memorizing rather than understanding. The knowledge-centered environment provides the necessary depth of study, assessing student understanding rather than factual memory. It incorporates the teaching of meta-cognitive strategies that further facilitate future learning. ([36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=36&annotation=B3W4DHR6)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>3. Formative assessments—ongoing assessments designed to make students’ thinking visible to both teachers and students—are essential. They permit the teacher to grasp the students’ preconceptions, understand where the students are in the “developmental corridor” from informal to formal thinking, and design instruction accordingly. In the assessment-centered classroom environment, formative assessments help both teachers and students monitor progress.

> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>4. Learning is influenced in fundamental ways by the context in which it takes place. A community-centered approach requires the development of norms for the classroom and school, as well as connections to the outside world, that support core learning values. ([37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VHFA2CAM?page=37&annotation=SWPP7S5K))

>Teachers must attend to designing classroom activities and helping students organize their work in ways that promote the kind of intellectual camaraderie and the attitudes toward learning that build a sense of community. In such a community, students might help one another solve problems by building on each other’s knowledge, asking questions to clarify explanations, and suggesting avenues that would move the group toward its goal (Brown and Campione, 1994).
