>I suggest we consider the similarities between Learning Sciences and other LIDT fields as analogous to convergent evolution in evolutionary biology—the process by which dolphins and sharks evolved similar traits but were preceded by different genetic histories. There is certainly much overlap in what each field does and the spaces each inhabits, but the histories leading up to each are markedly different.

> [!results]+ Note  
>Thus far, what one should be able to see from this gloss of Learning Sciences history is the major areas of research. For instance, cognitive science and artificial intelligence figured prominently. Understanding how to best model knowledge and understanding in complex domains continued to be a major strand of research. New technological media and a focus on children expressing and exploring new ideas through computer programming played prominently. There were also inclinations to look at story structure as it related to human memory in order to improve the design of tools and technologies for learning. Finally, there was a desire to take all these discoveries and findings and try to get them to work in actual learning settings rather than laboratories.

> [!results]+ Note  
>A major, if not primary, strand of Learning Sciences research is based on a sociocultural perspective on learning ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=4&annotation=2K3PZ6HZ))

>Jean Lave ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=5&annotation=B33NYUSU)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Lave, an anthropologist by training, had studied how mathematics was done in everyday life, discovering that what mathematics looked like in practice was very different from how mathematics understanding was conceptualized by the cognitive psychologists ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=5&annotation=4R6LSRUI)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Lave and Wenger published a seminal monograph, Situated Learning (1991), summarizing several cases of learning as it took place in actual communities of practice. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=5&annotation=APM3K5DW)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>they earned the attention of Greeno (Greeno &amp; Nokes-Malach, 2016) and others by suggesting that entirely different units of analysis were necessary for people to study learning. These perspectives were largely cultural and social in nature, taking talk and interaction and material artifacts as they were taken up in practice as critical. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=5&annotation=JB43TQ79)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>At the time, there were also groundbreaking works published, such as the translation of Lev Vygotsky’s work (1978), Barbara Rogoff’s studies of real-world apprenticeship (Rogoff, 1990), and Edwin Hutchins’s bold proposal that AI approaches to cognitive science were being far too restrictive in recognizing and understanding cognition as it happened “in the wild” (Hutchins, 1995).

> [!results]+ Note  
>In essence, a critique of mainstream cognitive science and an alternative perspective had emerged and attracted a contingent. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=5&annotation=FU4T5TKL)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Much of contemporary Learning Sciences research has extended these ideas. Rather than focusing on knowledge, many learning scientists focus on social practices, whether they be scientific or mathematical practices, classroom practices, or informal practices. Identity as a socially constructed and continually mediated construct has become a major concern. Seeking continuities between cultures (with cultures not necessarily being geographical nor ethnic in nature) and discovering how to design activities, tools, or routines that are taken up by a culture or give greater understanding of how cultures operate remain ongoing quests. Other concerns include historicity, marginalization of communities, cultural assets rather than cultural deficits, equity, social justice, and social and material influences on spaces that are intended to support learning. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=5&annotation=27VXX29H)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>Computer-supported Collaborative Learning ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=5&annotation=ERFVLC77)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>In the early days of Learning Sciences, cognitive and sociocultural perspectives figured prominently, ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=5&annotation=FUA7BAGZ)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>CSCL, like the rest of the Learning Sciences community, was also seriously interested in cognition, new technologies, and social contexts of learning. However, if there were some distinguishing features of the CSCL community, the focus on technology-mediated group cognition figured prominently. ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=6&annotation=4GSMU2A5)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>Design-based Research ([7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=7&annotation=B329YX5S)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>As an interdisciplinary field with a mix of cognitive, computational, sociocultural, and anthropological traditions all in dialogue, the methodological palette began with and maintained a great deal of diversity. Controlled experiments, thinkaloud protocols, interview studies, field work, and computational modeling all appear in Learning Sciences research along with other methods and methodological approaches. However, Learning Sciences strongly associates itself also with the articulation of design-based research as a methodology. ([7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=7&annotation=8JUMMS8N)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>The simplest articulation of design-based research is that it involves researchers working with real educational settings and introducing new tools, practices, or activities that embody a set of assumptions that exist based on prior research. ([7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=7&annotation=LSG2TGPY)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>The benefit of this type of research is that it puts theoretical assertions (e.g., metacognitive supports improve text comprehension) in harm’s way by allowing for the complexity of the real world to be introduced. This helps to refine (or even establish) stronger theory that speaks to complexities of how learning works in different systems.

> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>Learning Sciences and LIDT Fields ([8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J83SKD63?page=8&annotation=4D6EQSL9)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>To summarize, Learning Sciences has a history that gives it its unique character. That history is tied to cognitive science and artificial intelligence, to new forms of educational media, to sociocultural and situative critiques and studies of learning, to group cognition as it involves multiple learners and technology mediation, and to an appreciation for what design can do in service of advancing academic knowledge.
