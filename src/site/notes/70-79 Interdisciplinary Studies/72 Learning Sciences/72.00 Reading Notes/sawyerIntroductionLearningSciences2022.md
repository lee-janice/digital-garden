>1 An Introduction to the Learning Sciences ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=1&annotation=XNQ64HBF)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>The learning sciences (LS) is an interdisciplinary field that studies teaching and learning. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=1&annotation=GE39DL86)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>The goal of LS is to better understand the cognitive and social processes that result in the most effective learning and to use this knowledge to redesign classrooms and other learning environments so that people learn more deeply and more effectively. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=1&annotation=ZN3N2C9R)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>it draws on cognitive science, educational psychology, computer science, anthropology, sociology, information sciences, education, design studies, instructional design, and other fields. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=1&annotation=QCSH9ZQW)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>LS was born in 1991, when the first academic conference was held and the Journal of the Learning Sciences was first published. The conference and the journal grew in size and influence during the 1990s. In 2002, the professional society was formed, the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS). In 2006 the first edition of this handbook was published, followed by the second edition in 2014, and this third edition in 2022. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=1&annotation=EKYPIIXN)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>As a result, the schools we have today were designed around commonsense assumptions that had never been tested scientifically: • Knowledge is a collection of facts about the world and procedures for how to solve problems. Facts are statements like “The earth is tilted on its axis by 23.45 degrees” and procedures are step-by-step instructions like how to do multidigit addition by carrying to the next column. ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=1&annotation=G5R8AYF4)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>• The goal of schooling is to get these facts and procedures into the student’s head. People are considered to be educated when they possess a large collection of these facts and procedures. • Teachers know these facts and procedures, and their job is to transmit them to students. • Simple facts and procedures should be learned first, followed by progressively more complex facts and procedures. The definitions of “simplicity” and “complexity” and the proper sequencing of material is determined either by teachers, by textbook authors, or by asking expert adults like mathematicians, scientists, or historians – not by studying how children actually learn. • The way to determine the success of schooling is to test students to see how many of these facts and procedures they have acquired. ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=2&annotation=IGLP56AJ)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>Learning scientists often refer to this traditional pedagogy as instructionism following a similar critique of it by Seymour Papert, the pioneering constructionist theorist and the creator of the Logo programming language for children (Papert, 1993). ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=2&annotation=NTRB7JQZ)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>The importance of deeper conceptual understanding: Expert knowledge includes facts and procedures, but simply acquiring those facts and procedures does not prepare a person to use that knowledge creatively. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=3&annotation=L5BU6EKY)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>Connected learning: Each small piece of knowledge is linked to many others, in the same subject and also across disciplines, in a network of related knowledge. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=3&annotation=QITI8DHR)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>Focusing on learning in addition to teaching: Students cannot learn deeper conceptual understanding simply from teachers instructing them better. Students can only learn this by actively participating in their own learning. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=3&annotation=TJTNYDKM)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>Designing learning environments: The job of schools is to help students learn the full range of knowledge required for expert adult performance: facts and procedures, of course, but also the deeper conceptual understanding that will allow them to reason about real-world problems. ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=3&annotation=QPVYEZV9)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>The importance of groups and contexts: Students often learn more effectively when they participate in collaborative activities with peers and the teacher ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=3&annotation=4RA7ERWI)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>The importance of building on a learner’s prior knowledge: Learners are not empty vessels waiting to be filled. They come to the classroom with preconceptions about how the world works; some of them are basically correct, and some of them are misconceptions. The best way for children to learn is in an environment that builds on their existing knowledge ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=4&annotation=M6RYR5A7)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>The importance of reflection: Students learn better when they express their developing knowledge – either through conversation or by creating papers, reports, or other artifacts – and then are provided with opportunities to reflectively analyze their state of knowledge ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=4&annotation=4N2MRQ7L))

> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.1 The Goals of Education and the Nature of Knowledge ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=6&annotation=9CH595Q2)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>One of the most important findings of LS is that students learn deeper knowledge when they engage in activities that are similar to the everyday activities of professionals who work in a discipline. ([8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=8&annotation=AR4RCT3R)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>Authentic practices are the keystone of many recent educational standards documents in many countries. ([8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=8&annotation=7XKID5XF)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>Studies of knowledge workers show that they almost always apply their expertise in complex social settings with a wide array of technologically advanced tools along with old-fashioned pencil, paper, chalk, and blackboards. These observations have led LS researchers to a situativity view of knowledge (Engeström, Chapter 7 in this volume). ([8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=8&annotation=3UHTXAAE)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>“Situativity” means that knowledge is not just a static mental structure inside the learner’shead; instead, knowing is a process that involves the person, the tools and other people in the environment, and the activities in which that knowledge is being applied. ([8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=8&annotation=N7A2LVIE)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>One of the most important goals of LS research is to identify exactly what practices are appropriate for students to engage in and how learning environments can be designed that are age-appropriate without losing the authenticity of professional practice. ([9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=9&annotation=MWJYZ7AK)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.2 Processes Involved in Learning ([9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=9&annotation=GBGVSV3B)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.2.1 How Does Learning Happen: The Transition from Novice to Expert Performance ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=10&annotation=BM22Q3DW)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>When AI researchers became interested in education, they had to consider a new twist: How do experts acquire their expertise? What are the mental stages that learners go through as they move from novice to expert? This question was the purview of cognitive development research, a group of researchers that combined developmental psychology and cognitive psychology. Cognitive development has been an important foundation for LS, including the influential theories of twentiethcentury psychologists like Lev Vygotsky and Jean Piaget (Nathan &amp; Sawyer, Chapter 2 in this volume). ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=10&annotation=695U5ZY6)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.2.2 How Does Learning Happen: Using Prior Knowledge ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=10&annotation=4DUQVFHF)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>One of the most important discoveries guiding LS is that learning always takes place against a backdrop of existing knowledge. ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=10&annotation=GSN4QWID)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.2.3 Promoting Better Learning: Scaffolding ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=10&annotation=Q8WBKEY8)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>constructivism ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=10&annotation=P7C3Y3ZQ)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>Scaffolding is ([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=10&annotation=T8N9CEAI)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>support given to a learner that is tailored to that learner’s needs in achieving their goals of the moment. The best scaffolding provides this support in a way that helps children discover the answer on their own. ([11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=11&annotation=BJ8WVHIY)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.2.4 Promoting Better Learning: Externalization and Articulation ([11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=11&annotation=CP5QNEN7)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>LS has discovered that when learners externalize and articulate their developing knowledge, they learn more effectively ([11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=11&annotation=49XUEFTG)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>This fascinating phenomenon was first studied in the 1920s by Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky. In the 1970s, when educational psychologists began to notice the same phenomenon, Vygotsky’swritingswereincreasingly translated into English and other languages, and Vygotsky is now considered one of the foundational theorists of LS (see Engeström, Chapter 7 in this volume; Nathan &amp; Sawyer, Chapter 2 in this volume). Vygotsky’s explanation for the educational value of articulation is based in a theory of mental development that is both social and psychological: he argued that all knowledge begins as visible social interaction and then is gradually internalized by the learner to form new thoughts and concepts. ([11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=11&annotation=BXU6P5SV)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>One of the most important topics of LS is how to support students in this ongoing process of articulation. ([11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=11&annotation=ZZYVGF4G)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.2.5 Promoting Better Learning: Reflection ([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=12&annotation=A7CK7TWX)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>metacognition – thinking about the process of learning at the same time that you are learning ([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=12&annotation=FVRY63JH)) 


> [!key-conclusion]+ Key Conclusion  
>Learning scientists have repeatedly demonstrated the importance of reflection in learning for deeper understanding. ([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=12&annotation=9YHNBB3J)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.2.6 Promoting Better Learning: Building from Concrete to Abstract Knowledge ([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=12&annotation=DWVSMCG6)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>One of the most well-known findings of developmental psychologist Jean Piaget is that the natural progression of learning starts with more concrete information that gradually becomes more abstract. ([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=12&annotation=GHC6AQ4Y)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>LS has taken Piaget’s original insight and has developed computer software to visually represent a wide range of types of knowledge. ([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=12&annotation=LUZMUTSE)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.3 Sociocultural Studies ([13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=13&annotation=4RP5FZJ2)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>a group of interrelated approaches including the sociocultural, situative,anddistributed cognition approaches ([13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=13&annotation=TEBZVU25)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Socioculturalists began with the observation that all intelligent behavior was realized in a complex environment – a human-created environment filled with tools and machines, but also a deeply social environment with collaborators and partners. ([13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=13&annotation=23P78ZLN)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>ituated social practices – visible social and interactional patterns that combine people, cultural practices, and material tools. Esmonde (2017) noted that this line of research studies how learning “is distributed across the people, artifacts, and social relations in a given context” (p. 13). ([14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=14&annotation=347A9A5B)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Like the findings of cognitive psychology, the findings of sociocultural research also have broad applicability to learning across countries, societies, and cultures. ([14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=14&annotation=2UFZZZC2)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.4 Social Justice and the Learning Sciences ([15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=15&annotation=A7796M42)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>The LS foundation in sociocultural frameworks has made it a receptive home for scholars studying how schooling reproduces social inequity and how pedagogy can be reformed to further social justice and equity. ([15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=15&annotation=A5U87PGE)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.5 Educational Technology ([16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=16&annotation=IZCMELKC)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Learning scientists have found that computers only benefitlearningwhen they take into account what we know about how children learn, and when they are designed to be closely integrated with teacher and student interactions in the classroom. ([16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=16&annotation=6TTCXF2E)) 


> [!results]+ Note  
>Computer technology is central in LS because the visual and processing power of today’s computers supports deep learning: • Computers can represent abstract knowledge in concrete form. • Computer tools can allow learners to articulate and reflect on their developing knowledge in a visual and verbal way. • Computers can allow learners to manipulate and revise their developing knowledge in a complex process of design that supports simultaneous articulation, reflection, and learning. • Internet-based networks of learners can share and combine their developing understandings and benefit from the power of collaborative learning. ([17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=17&annotation=8UIQC7FK)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.6 Methodologies ([17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=17&annotation=RPU5U2EL)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>In education research, one common methodology is the experimental design, in which students are randomly assigned to different learning environments. Many education studies are also quasi-experimental – rather than randomly assigning students to environments, the researcher identifies two existing classrooms that are similar on most variables but different on the one variable being studied. ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=18&annotation=43D3ADS4)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>The chapters in this book use a diversity of methodologies: experimental comparisons of classrooms, experiments in cognitive psychology laboratories, studies of social interaction using the methodologies of sociology and anthropology, and a new hybrid methodology known as design-based research ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=18&annotation=B3WJCQHJ)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>To study learning in rich social and technological environments, learning scientists have drawn on ethnography (from anthropology), ethnomethodology and conversation analysis (from sociology), and sociocultural psychology (from both anthropology and developmental psychology). ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=18&annotation=K5QRE8BL)) 


> [!methods]+ Vocabulary  
>Many learning scientists study the moment-to-moment processes of learning, typically by gathering large amounts of videotape data, and they use a range of methodologies to analyze these videotapes back in the laboratory – a set of methodologies known as interaction analysis ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=18&annotation=C2U2QRDZ)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.7 The Emergence of the Field of Learning Sciences ([19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=19&annotation=K8SCVYRR)) 


> [!research-questions]+ Heading  
>1.8 Conclusion ([21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DKAAXVJD?page=21&annotation=WYILN7FI))
