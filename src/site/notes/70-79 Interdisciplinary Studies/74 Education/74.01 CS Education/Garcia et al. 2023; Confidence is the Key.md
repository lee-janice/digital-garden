## Abstract 

> [!abstract]
> As computing education begins to grow in K-12 classrooms, it is increasingly important to understand the relationships between a student’s coding attitudes and computing outcomes. While work has been done at the undergraduate and high school level, less is known about elementary students, and even less about Latinx students. We sought to explore the connections between Latinx elementary students’ coding attitudes and computational thinking (CT) skills after participating in a year-long, remote computing curriculum in a public school district in Southern California. We collected validated measures on coding attitudes and CT skills for 164 fourth-grade students. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the relationship between the coding attitude constructs (i.e., confidence, utility, perception of coders, social influences, and interest) and scores on a CT assessment while controlling for demographic factors (i.e., gender, English language fluency, free or reduced lunch status, reading and math standardized test scores). In a model demonstrating acceptable fit, only math scores were a significant predictor of CT scores and coding confidence. Confidence was found to be significantly associated with the other attitude constructs except for perception of coders. Our results indicate that confidence plays a prominent role in student computing learning, especially at a young age. Efforts to better support Latinx students in computer science should include strategies that address students’ coding confidence, such as developing positive perceptions of a student’s learning process (e.g., failures as learning opportunities) in specific coding skills and practices (e.g., tinkering, debugging).

> [!quote]   Key Concept    
> <mark class="customZot-Yellow ">Our research question for this study was: Which coding attitude constructs significantly influence Latinx, elementary students’ computational thinking (CT) knowledge upon exposure to a CT curriculum? To what extent is coding attitudes and CT performance informed by student background (i.e., gender, English language fluency, free-reduced lunch status, math and reading test scores )?</mark> ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAUVEI4K?page=2&annotation=GBJ2TXBI)) 


> [!quote]   Key Concept    
> <mark class="customZot-Yellow ">We primarily focus this literature review on confidence. This is due to our results finding that confidence is the only coding attitude construct with a significant relation to CT skills, as well as confidence having the most associated research in the computing education research literature.</mark> ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAUVEI4K?page=2&annotation=NME4Y2PR)) 


> [!quote]    Key Word   
> <mark class="customZot-Green ">Confidence is a metacognitive experience wherein an individual’s behavior is dependent upon their certainty of success in an act [45]. Therefore, confidence represents the perceived likelihood that something will happen given the realities of the present or prior lived experiences [30].</mark> ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAUVEI4K?page=2&annotation=JHT32TPI)) 


> [!quote]    Key Word   
> <mark class="customZot-Green ">The use of the term &quot;confidence&quot; is complicated in the space of CS education. Confidence may refer to: confidence using computers [26, 26, 51]; prediction of course performance [17, 25]; a subconstruct of programming empowerment [31].</mark> ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAUVEI4K?page=2&annotation=QFUQTDQT)) 


> [!quote]   Key Concept    
> <mark class="customZot-Yellow ">Confidence has been found to be correlated with CS course grades or other performance measures [5, 17, 20, 26, 29, 41, 47, 51] or predictive of student performance in an introductory CS course [7, 33, 40, 54].</mark> ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAUVEI4K?page=2&annotation=WJ5M2K3Z)) 


> [!quote]   Key Concept    
> <mark class="customZot-Yellow ">In the case of variables pertaining to student background, only student standardized test performance in reading and math resulted in a significant association to CT skills.</mark> ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAUVEI4K?page=4&annotation=QD6KRV8A)) 


> [!quote]   Key Concept    
> <mark class="customZot-Yellow ">Math performance is the only direct effect on CT skills ( 𝛽 = 0.466, 𝜌 &lt; .001). However, this relationship is mediated by student coding confidence in CT skills (𝛽 = 0.270, 𝜌 &lt; .05). Additionally, student coding interest significantly mediates the relationship between math scores and student coding confidence as math scores inform coding interest (𝛽 = 0.333, 𝜌 &lt; .05), and interest is significantly associated with coding confidence (𝛽 = 0.712, 𝜌 &lt; .000). Finally, reading scores had a negative association with coding confidence (𝛽 = −0.336, 𝜌 &lt; .05).</mark> ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAUVEI4K?page=4&annotation=9S5CT8C3))

> [!quote]   Key Concept    
> <mark class="customZot-Yellow ">Despite the significant association between the coding attitude constructs (with the exception of confidence with perception), only confidence significantly predicted CT performance. This indicates that confidence stands out among the other constructs.</mark> ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAUVEI4K?page=4&annotation=23U5QZLF))

> [!quote]   Key Concept    
> <mark class="customZot-Yellow ">Our model reveals insights into the impact of math and reading skills on confidence and CT performance. On one hand, our model aligns and further expands prior findings that standardized tests scores in math are a factor in CS achievement [6–8, 42, 54]. Yet, we found that reading scores were negatively related to coding confidence. Prior research in CS education has indicated that reading ability plays a role in CT learning outcomes, sometimes even more so than mathematics ability [42]. Such findings imply that learning to code requires the same skills and practices as learning to read, including at the fourth-grade level, due to transferable practices (e.g., comprehension skills, conditional reading skills). Thus our inverse finding, that as reading scores increase, coding confidence decreases, deserves more investigation as to the root cause and implications of this relationship.</mark> ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAUVEI4K?page=6&annotation=8TUX29MQ))
